## Chapter 4

## Integration through the Operations Process

This chapter discusses how the cyberspace electromagnetic activities section integrates cyberspace operations and electromagnetic warfare through the operations process. It outlines  the  four  activities  of  the  operations  process  and  how  the  working  group contributes to each activity. This chapter details how the cyberspace electromagnetic activities  section  and  members  of  the  working  group  synchronize  cyberspace operations and electromagnetic warfare with intelligence preparation of the battlefield, information  collection,  targeting,  risk  management,  and  knowledge  management processes.

## SECTION I - THE OPERATIONS PROCESS

4-1. At corps and below, the planning, synchronization, and integration of cyberspace operations and EW are conducted by the CEMA section, in collaboration with key staff members that make up the CEMA working group. The CEMA section is an element of the G-3 or S-3 and works closely with members of the CEMA working group to ensure unity of effort to meet the commander's objectives. Integration and synchronization of cyberspace operations and EW-

-  Unifies Army and joint forces' effort to engineer, manage, secure, and defend the DODIN.
-  Ensures information collected in cyberspace and the EMS is routed to the appropriate staff to provide the commander and staff for situational awareness of the OE, targeting, and as potential intelligence.
-  Ensures the efficient use of cyberspace operations and EW assets for information collection and targeting.
-  Ensures appropriate coordination between Army, joint, unified action partners and host nations before employing cyberspace operations and EW.

4-2. The operations  process includes  the  major  command  and  control  activities  performed  during operations: planning, preparing, executing, and continuously assessing the operation (ADP 5-0). The operations process is the Army's framework for the organization and implementation of command and control. The CEMA working group enables the commander with the ability to understand cyberspace and the EMOE. With this understanding,  the  commander  can  better  visualize  and  describe  an  operation's  end  state  and  operational approach;  this  in  turn  enables  the  commander  to  make  and  articulate  decisions,  direct,  lead,  and  assess operations. The commander and staff at a corps or division must align the commander's concept of operations with adjacent corps and divisions, joint forces, and unified action partners when conducting large-scale combat operations to ensure unity of effort.

4-3. Commanders,  staff,  and  subordinate  headquarters  use  the  operations  process  to  organize  efforts, integrate the warfighting functions across multiple domains, and synchronize forces to accomplish missions. Army forces plan, prepare, execute, and assess cyberspace operations and EW in collaboration with joint forces and unified action partners as required. Army commanders and staffs will likely coordinate or interact with joint forces to facilitate cyberspace operations and EW. For this reason, commanders and staff should have an awareness of joint planning systems and processes that enable cyberspace operations and EW. Some of these systems and processes include-

-  The Joint Planning Process (See JP 5-0).
-  Adaptive Planning (See JP 5-0).
-  Review and approval process for cyberspace operations (Refer to Appendixes A and C).

-  Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Planning Process (See JP 3-85).

## PLANNING

4-4. Planning is the art and science of understanding a situation, envisioning a desired future, and laying out effective ways of bringing that future about (ADP 5-0). Commanders apply the art of command and the science  of  control  to  ensure  cyberspace  operations  and  EW  support  the  concept  of  operations.  Whether cyberspace operations and EW are planned and directed from higher headquarters or requested from tactical units,  timely  staff  actions  and  commanders'  involvement  coupled  with  continued  situational  awareness  of cyberspace and the EMS are critical for mission success.

- 4-5. The Army design methodology and military decision-making process are two planning methods used by Army headquarters. Members of the CEMA working group must understand these two methods fully. See Appendix A for a detailed discussion on how CEMA integrates cyberspace operations and EW within Army design methodology and the military decision-making process.
- 4-6. The Army design methodology consists of more adductive and systemic reasoning for complex, illformed problems. The military decision-making process consists of a more deductive and analytical approach to planning and commanders at corps and below are likely to employ military decision-making process more frequently than Army design methodology. Commanders, however, may use a different approach to planning or combine approaches. Regardless of the planning approach, commanders and staff must integrate cyberspace operations and EW throughout the planning activity. During planning, commanders and staff should seek to-
-  Understand situations and develop solutions to problems. The commander and staff build an understanding of the cyberspace domain, information aspects of the OE, and the EMOE within the  assigned  AO.  Commanders  and  staff  develop  a  situational  understanding  of  the  impact cyberspace  operations  and  EW  effects  can  cause  throughout  multiple  domains  and  develop solutions to resolve issues that might negatively affect neutral entities and friendly forces.
-  Task-organize  the  force  and  prioritize  efforts. The  commander  and  staff  task-organizes cyberspace and EW capabilities and implement priority of support efforts. A priority of support is a priority set by the commander to ensure a subordinate unit has support in accordance with its relative importance to accomplish the mission (ADP 5-0).
-  Direct, coordinate, and synchronize action. The commander and staff use this planning function to  direct,  coordinate,  and  synchronize  cyberspace  operations,  EW,  and  spectrum  management operations  with  missions  conducted  through  intelligence  operations,  IO  operations,  and  the targeting process.
-  Anticipate events and adapt to changing circumstances. The commander and staff anticipate potential  attacks  by  threats  in  cyberspace  and  the  EMS  and  adapts  to  the  uncertain  nature  of operations  by  implementing  active  and  passive  countermeasures  associated  with  cyberspace security and EP. The commander and staff use such tools as decision points, branches, and sequels to adapt to changing circumstances (See ADP 5-0).
- 4-7. The IPB process begins and is synchronized with the operations process during planning and continues throughout the operations process. During the IPB process, the G-2 or S-2 supports cyberspace operations and EW by providing the commander and staff with analyzed intelligence on the operational and mission variables in  an  area  of  interest  to  determine  conditions  relevant  to  those  operations.  This  information  assists  the commander and staff in understanding the OE, identifying opportunities for cyberspace operations and EW, and determining appropriate COAs.

4-8. During planning, the fires support element uses the commander's intent and concept of operations to develop a fire support plan. The fire support plan is a plan that addresses each means of fire support available. It  describes  how  Army  indirect  fires,  joint  fires,  and  target  acquisition  are  integrated  with  a  maneuver  to facilitate operational success (refer to FM 3-09). The fires support coordinator or support officer collaborates with the CEWO to integrate cyberspace attacks and EA into the fire support plan.

- 4-9. The final product of planning is an operation plan (OPLAN) or operation order (OPORD). The OPLAN is developed by the commander and staff well in advance of execution and becomes an OPORD once directed for  implementation based on a specific time or event. The CEWO is responsible for completing Annex C, Appendix 12, and upon request, assists the G-6 or S-6 with Annex H, Appendixes 1 and 6 of the OPLAN or

OPORD. The CEWO is also responsible for making updates, changes, and modifications to Annex C, Appendix 12  and  assisting  in  updating  Annex  H,  Appendixes  1  and  6  as  appropriate,  for  fragmentary  order(s) (FRAGORDs) (See Appendix A for Army design methodology, military decision-making process , and CEMA products for orders).

## PREPARATION

4-10. Preparation consists of those activities performed by units and Soldiers to improve their ability to execute  an  operation  (ADP  5.0).  Preparation  activities  include  initiating  information  collection,  DODIN operations preparation, rehearsals, training, and inspections. Preparation requires the commander, staff, unit, and Soldiers' active engagement to ensure the force is ready to execute operations.

4-11. Preparation activities typically begin during planning and continue into execution. At corps and below, subordinate units' that are task-organized to employ cyberspace operations and EW capabilities (identified in the OPLAN or OPORD) conduct preparation activities to improve the force's opportunity for success during operations.  Commanders  drive  preparation  activities  through  leading  and  assessing.  Using  the  following preparation functions, commanders and staff can-

-  Improve situational understanding. Commanders, staff, and subordinate units continue to refine knowledge of cyberspace and the EMOE within the assigned AO, including the improved insight on how the use of cyberspace and the EMS could affect operations across multiple domains.
-  Develop a shared understanding of the plan. Commanders, staff, and tasked subordinate units develop a shared understanding of the plan (described in the OPLAN or OPORD) by conducting home-station training  and  combat  training  center(s).  These  training  events  provide  the  perfect opportunity for subordinate commanders, leaders, and Soldiers to execute the developed plan in a controlled environment and to identify issues in the developing plan that require modification.
-  Train and become proficient in critical tasks. Through rehearsals and training, subordinate units gain and refine skills in those individual and collective tasks essential to the success of cyberspace operations  and  EW.  Commanders also allocate training time for anticipated  and  unanticipated events and circumstances.
-  Integrate the force. Commanders allocate preparation time to put the new task-organized force into effect. Integrating the force includes detaching units, moving cyberspace and EW assets, and receiving and integrating new units and Soldiers into the force. Task-organized forces require preparation time to learn the gaining unit's policies and standards and to understand their role in the overall plan. The gaining unit requires time to assess the task-organized forces' cyberspace and EW capabilities and limitations and integrate new capabilities.
-  Ensure  the  positioning  of  forces  and  resources. Positioning  and  task  organization  occur concurrently. Commanders ensure cyberspace and EA assets consist of the right personnel and equipment using pre-operations checks while ensuring those assets are in the right place at the right time.

## EXECUTION

4-12. Execution is the act of putting a plan into action by applying combat power to accomplish the mission (ADP 5-0). The commander, staff, and subordinate commander's focus on translating decisions made during planning and preparing into actions. Commanders conduct OCO and EA to project combat power throughout cyberspace  and  the  EMS,  conduct  DCO  and  EP  to  protect  friendly  forces  and  systems,  and  conduct reconnaissance  through  cyberspace  and  the  EMS  to  gather  combat  information  for  continuing  situational awareness.

4-13. Commanders should understand that detailed planning provides a reasonable forecast of execution but must  also  be  aware  that  situations  may  change  rapidly  in  cyberspace  and  the  EMOE.  During  execution, commanders take concerted action to seize, retain, and exploit operational initiative while accepting risk.

4-14. Operational initiative is the setting or tempo and terms of action throughout an operation (ADP 3-0). By  presenting  the  enemy  with  multiple  cross-domain  dilemmas,  including  cyberspace  and  the  EMS, commanders  force  the  enemy  to  react  continuously,  driving  the  enemy  into  positions  of  disadvantage.

Commanders  can  use  cyberspace  attacks  and  EA  to  force  enemy  commanders  to  abandon  their  preferred courses of action and make costly mistakes. Commanders retain the initiative by synchronizing cyberspace attacks and EA as fires combined with other elements of combat power to apply unrelenting pressure on the enemy using continuously changing combinations of combat power at a tempo an enemy cannot effectively counter.

- 4-15. Commanders and staff  continue  to  use  information  collection  and  electromagnetic  reconnaissance assets to identify enemy attempts to regain the initiative. Information collected can be used to readjust targeting priorities and fire support plans, including cyberspace attacks and EA, to keep adversaries on the defensive.
- 4-16. Once friendly forces seize the initiative, they immediately exploit it through continued operations to accelerate  the  enemy's  defeat. Defeat is  to  render  a  force  incapable  of  achieving  its  objective  (ADP  3-0). Commanders can use cyberspace attacks and EA to disrupt enemy attempts to reconstitute forces and exacerbate enemy disorganization by targeting adversary command and control and sensing nodes.

## ASSESSMENT

- 4-17. Assessment is the determination of the progress toward accomplishing a task, creating an effect, or achieving an objective (JP 3-0). The commander and staff continuously assess cyberspace operations and EW to  determine  if  they  have  resulted  in  the  desired  effect.  Assessment  activities  support  decision  making  by ascertaining the progress of the operation to develop and refine plans.
- 4-18. Assessment both precedes and guides the other activities of the operations process, and there is no single way to conduct it. Commanders develop an effective assessment plan built around the unique challenges of the operations. A Commander develops an assessment plan by-
-  Developing the assessment approach (planning).
-  Developing the assessment plan (planning).
-  Collecting information and intelligence (execution).
-  Analyzing information and intelligence (execution).
-  Communicating feedback and recommendations (execution).
-  Adapting plans or operations (planning and execution).

Note. For more information on the operations process, see ADP 5-0.

## SECTION II -INTEGRATING PROCESSES

- 4-19. Commanders and staff integrate warfighting functions and synchronize the force to adapt to changing circumstances throughout the operations process. The CEMA section aligns cyberspace operations and EW with the operations process and its associated integrating processes to identify threats in cyberspace and the EMS,  to  target  and  attack  enemy  cyberspace  and  EMS  enabled  systems,  and  to  support  the  warfighting functions.  Figure  4-1  on  page  4-5  illustrates  the  integration  and  synchronization  of  CEMA  throughout  the operations process using the various integrating processes.

4-20. The operations process is the principal essential activity conducted by a commander and staff. The commander and staff integrate and synchronize CEMA with five key integrating processes throughout the operations process (see figure 4-1). These integrating processes are-

-  IPB.
-  Information collection.
-  Targeting.
-  Risk management.
-  Knowledge management.

Figure 4-1. The operations process and integrating processes

<!-- image -->

## INTELLIGENCE PREPARATION OF THE BATTLEFIELD

4-21. To integrate and synchronize the tasks and missions of information collection, the G-2 or S-2 leads the staff through the IPB process. Intelligence preparation of the battlefield is the systematic process of analyzing the mission variables of enemy, terrain, weather, and civil considerations in an area of interest to determine their effect on operations (ATP 2-01.3). IPB assists in developing an in-depth understanding of relevant aspects of the OE, including threats.

4-22. Integrating the IPB process into the operations process is essential in supporting the commander's ability to understand the OE and visualize operations throughout the operations process. Integrating the IPB process and the operations process is an enabler that allows commanders to design and conduct operations continuously. Integrating the IPB process and the operations process provides the information and intelligence required to plan, prepare, execute, and assess operations. Four steps in the IPB process are-

-  Define the operational environment.
-  Describe environment effects on operations.
-  Evaluate the threat.
-  Determine threat COAs.

4-23. The IPB process begins during planning activities and continues throughout the operations process. The  IPB  process  results  in  IPB  products  used  for  developing  friendly  COAs  and  decision  points  for  the commander throughout planning activities. IPB products are critical to planning cyberspace operations and EW.

## DEFINE THE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT

4-24. The G-2 or S-2 uses the IPB process to define cyberspace and the EMOE within an OE. Defining the cyberspace and the EMOE enables the commander and staff to visualize both friendly and enemy cyberspace and EW assets through the three layers of cyberspace and the EMS. The CEMA section supports the IPB process by assisting the G-2 or S-2 with developing and managing the electromagnetic order of battle.

4-25. The G-2 or S-2 is responsible for synchronizing available SIGINT assets. Combat information attained through cyberspace operations and EW assists the G-2 or S-2 in defining the OE. Additionally, the G-2 or S-2 may  combine  the  intelligence  disciplines  with  criminal  intelligence  to  gather  cyberspace  and  EW-related information to define the OE fully.

4-26. The  G-2  or  S-2  uses  intelligence  gathered  through  information  collection  to  develop  graphic  AO overlays that include cyberspace and the EMS-related terrain aspects throughout the assigned AO. Graphic AO overlays of cyberspace may depict the physical layer of cyberspace more easily than the logical or cyberpersona layers. Attaining information on threat cyberspace capabilities at the logical and cyber-persona layers occurs through SIGINT, criminal intelligence, or cyberspace exploitation.

4-27. The G3 should ensure information gathered by operational systems, platforms, and sensors, such as those used to monitor friendly networks during the execution of DODIN operations, is formally disseminated and  made  accessible  to  the  intelligence  community.  This  is  a  critical  component  necessary  to  define  the operational environment in support of cyberspace operations, as well as to enable the G2 or S2 to evaluate the threat.

## DESCRIBE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON CYBERSPACE AND THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM

4-28. As a result of answering IRs received from the CEMA section, the G-2 or S-2 defines the types of threats and threat cyberspace and EW capabilities while also defining environmental effects. It is essential to consider how environmental effects will impact friendly and enemy operations, including those that may affect cyberspace  and  the  EMS.  Such  considerations  include  terrain,  weather,  light,  illumination  data,  and  civil. Terrain analysis allows the commander to understand the terrain's impact on cyberspace operations and EW. The CEMA working group conducts cyberspace and the EMS-related terrain analysis by employing traditional methods and examining the five military aspects of terrain when determining threat courses of action:

-  Observation and fields of fire.
-  Avenues of approach.
-  Key terrain.
-  Obstacles.
-  Cover and concealment.

4-29. Civil  considerations  are  applied  by  cross  walking  with  the  operational  variables.  The  G-2  or  S-2 includes  such  civil  considerations  as  cellular  phone  coverage,  internet  service  providers,  and  electricity distribution for industrial, commercial, and residential areas.

4-30. Threats  in  cyberspace  and  the  EMS  and  all  intelligence  gathered  and  analyzed  for  environmental effects are incorporated into such IPB products as the threat overlays, threat description tables, terrain effects matrices, terrain analysis, or modified combined obstacle overlay, and assessments.

## EVALUATE THE THREAT

4-31. In  collaboration  with  the  CEMA  section,  the  G-2  or  S-2  determines  threat  cyberspace  and  EW capabilities, doctrinal principles, and tactics, techniques, and procedures used by the enemy in the assigned AO. An enemy's use of the cyberspace and the EMS to accomplish or support their objectives vary. Using input from the various intelligence disciplines, The G-2 or S-2 and CEMA section evaluate the threat, create threat models, develop broad threat COAs, and identify enemy high value targets (HVTs). When creating the threat model, the G-2 or S-2 incorporates cyberspace and EMS consideration to determine how the enemy integrates and uses cyberspace and EW capabilities.

4-32. The  enemy  will  likely  have  cyberspace  and  EW  capabilities  that  operate  across  all  warfighting functions. To increase situational awareness, the G-2 or S-2 should identify enemy cyberspace and EMS assets employed in support of each warfighting function. The G-2 or S-2 also evaluates neutral actors and adversaries conducting operations in cyberspace and the EMS throughout the AO and forwards the information to local and Army law enforcement or counterintelligence elements. Neutral actors and adversaries include-

-  Nation-state actors.
-  Transnational non-state actors or terrorists.
-  Criminal organizations or multinational cyber syndicate actors.
-  Individual actors, hacktivists, or small groups.
-  Insider threats.
-  Autonomous systems, software, and malicious code.

4-33. Data  gathered  by  evaluating  the  threat  helps  develop  threat  models  that  depict  how  enemy  forces typically execute operations, including threat characteristics on how they use cyberspace and the EMS. The threat model also describes how enemy forces historically reacted to various types of cyberspace attacks and EA in similar circumstances relative to OE and overall operation.

4-34. In addition to the threat model, the G-2 or S-2 creates threat capability statements that align with the threat model and include options or other supporting operations the enemy can use to affect the accomplishment of the friendly forces' mission. Threat models guide the development of threat COAs.

## DETERMINE THREAT COURSES OF ACTION

4-35. The G-2 or S-2 uses data gathered through threat evaluation to identify and develop the full range of COAs an enemy has available. The G-2 or S-2 collaborates with the CEMA section to develop threat COAs regarding an enemy's capabilities in cyberspace and the EMS. The G-2 or S-2 provides the G-3 or S-3 with information and intelligence necessary for developing friendly COAs to counter those available threats COAs and  influence  friendly  operations.  The  G-2  or  S-2  also  collaborates  with  the  CEMA  section  to  develop countermeasures to threat COAs in cyberspace and the EMS. Each threat COA includes identified cyberspace attack and EA-related HVTs such as nodes, command and control centers, communications towers, satellites, internet service providers, fiber optic lines, and local power substations.

4-36. When developing friendly COAs related to countering the enemy's capabilities in cyberspace and the EMS,  the  G-2  or  S-2,  in  collaboration  with  the  CEMA  section,  incorporates  such  considerations  as  the adversary's historical use of cyberspace and the EMS and the types of cyberspace and EMS-related operations they have conducted. The G-2 or S-2 assists the CEMA section in determining the unit's specific cyberspace and EW assets that can produce desired effects when engaging HVTs.

4-37. The G-2 or S-2 should understand that a cyberspace threat could be operating outside of the unit's assigned AO. An enemy can use proxies worldwide beyond a unit's area of interest. Development of threat

COAs results from first identifying HVTs and HPTs. Threat COAs include templates and event matrices that identify potential objectives, named areas of interest and target areas of interest. A named area of interest is the geospatial  area  or  systems  node  or  link  against  which  information  that  will  satisfy  a  specific  information requirement can be collected (JP 2-01.3). A target area of interest is the geographical area where high-value targets can be acquired and engaged by friendly forces (JP 2-01.3).

4-38. The CEMA section conducts terrain analysis to examine aspects of terrain in cyberspace and the EMS for determining obstacles such as firewalls, port blocks, threat sensors, and jamming capabilities that require immediate  mitigation  for  continued  operation.  The  CEMA  section  also  identifies  the  various  avenues  of approach to employ cyberspace attack and EA on enemy cyberspace and EMS capabilities. Through terrain analysis, the CEMA identifies potential weaknesses in friendly forces' posture in cyberspace and the EMS that require  additional  cover  and  concealment  through  such  techniques  as  electromagnetic  hardening  actions, password protection, emission control, or by incorporating Internet Protocol (IP) hiding techniques.

4-39. During terrain analysis, it is important to identify key locations in cyberspace and the EMS that can become access points. These access points provide avenues of approach or can provide observation and fields of  fire  where  network  traffic  can  be  monitored,  intercepted,  or  recorded  through  SIGINT,  cyberspace exploitation,  or  ES.  By  identifying  cyberspace  and  EW-related  obstacles,  avenues  of  approach,  cover  and concealment, and observation and fields of fire, the CEMA section can determine locations in those aspects of terrain to consider as key terrains. Key terrains include those major access points for observing incoming threats and avenues for launching cyberspace attack and EA. Terrain in cyberspace and the EMS connected to critical assets on the DODIN are considered as key terrains.

Note. For more information on the IPB process, see ATP 2-01.3.

## INFORMATION COLLECTION

4-40. Information collection is an activity that synchronizes and integrates the planning and employment of sensors and assets as well as the processing, exploitation, and dissemination systems in direct support of current and future operations (FM 3-55). These sensors and assets may include cyberspace operations and EW assets conducting cyberspace exploitation operations, electromagnetic probing, and electromagnetic reconnaissance for information collection.

4-41. Information  collection  is  the  acquisition  of  information  and  the  provision  of  this  information  to processing elements. Information collection integrates the intelligence and operations staff functions with a focus on answering the CCIRs, and IRs that assists the commander and staff in shaping the OE and conducting operations. The commander drives information collection coordinated by the staff and led by the G-2 or S-2. The following are the steps of information collection:

-  Plan requirements and assess collection.
-  Task and direct collection.
-  Execute collection.

4-42. Information collection enables the commander to understand and visualize the operation. Information collection identifies gaps in information that require aligning intelligence assets with cyberspace exploitation, electromagnetic reconnaissance, and electromagnetic probing to collect data on those gaps. The decide and detect steps of targeting also rely heavily on information collection. Enemy cyberspace capabilities identified through information collection assist the CEMA working group in identifying potential targets and key terrain in cyberspace.

## PLAN REQUIREMENTS AND ASSESS COLLECTION

4-43. The G-2 or S-2 collaborates with the other staff to receive and validate IRs for collection. The CEMA section  provides  the  G-2  or  S-2  with  cyberspace  and  EMS-related  IRs  requesting  information  on  friendly, enemy, and neutral actors operating in the AO. The CEWO identifies all cyberspace and EMS-related IRs to present to the commander as potential CCIRs. The G-2 or S-2 prepares the requirements planning tools and recommend cyberspace and EW assets for information collection to the G-3 or S-3.

## TASK AND DIRECT COLLECTION

4-44. In  addition  to  the  G-2  or  S-2  using  SIGINT  for  information  collection,  the  G-3  or  S-3  may  task cyberspace and EW assets to support the information collection effort. In this instance, the CEMA section will assist the G-2 or S-2 by assigning organic EW assets while requesting additional EW and cyberspace assets as required. The G-2 or S-2 is responsible for maintaining the synchronization of all assets used for the information collection efforts.

## EXECUTE COLLECTION

4-45. The focus when executing information collection is to collect data that answers CCIRs and IRs for analysis during the IPB process. This information assists in shaping the OE and attaining information on the enemy.  Collection  activities  acquire  information  about  the  enemy,  including  their  cyberspace  and  EMSdependent capabilities and assets. Collection activities begin shortly after the receipt of the mission activities of the operations process and continue throughout preparation and execution activities.

4-46. The G-2 or S-2 executes collection by conducting-

-  Intelligence operations.
-  Reconnaissance.
-  Surveillance.
-  Security operations.

## Intelligence Operations

4-47. Intelligence operations are the tasks undertaken by military intelligence units through the intelligence disciplines to obtain information to satisfy validated requirements (ADP 2-0). Through intelligence operations, the  G-2  or  S-2  attains  information  regarding  threat  capabilities,  activities,  disposition,  and  characteristics. Intelligence operations use multiple intelligence disciplines to collect information regarding cyberspace and the EMS to satisfy CCIRs and IRs. However, knowledge attained from the other intelligence disciplines may also provide cyberspace and EMS related insight. In addition to gathering information on peer and near-peer threats through SIGINT, criminal intelligence collects information on cyberspace and EMS-related illegal activities conducted throughout the assigned AO. For more information on criminal intelligence, refer to AR 195-2.

## Reconnaissance

4-48. Reconnaissance is a mission undertaken to obtain, by visual observation or other detection methods, information about the activities  and  resources  of  an  enemy  or  adversary,  or  to  secure  data  concerning  the meteorological,  hydrographic,  or  geographic  characteristics  of  a  particular  area  (JP  2-0).  Reconnaissance produces information about the assigned AO. Through reconnaissance, the G-2 or S-2 can collect information regarding such mission and operational variables as terrain characteristics, enemy and friendly obstacles to movement, and the disposition of enemy  forces and civilians. Combined employment  of three  methods of reconnaissance (dismounted, mounted, and aerial) can result in the location and type(s) of friendly, civilian, and threat cyberspace and EW capabilities operating in the assigned AO. Upon request, the CEMA section supports  the  G-2  or  S-2's  reconnaissance  efforts  by  employing  EW  assets  to  conduct  electromagnetic reconnaissance to collect information in the EMS and request OCO support to conduct cyberspace exploitation in cyberspace.

## Surveillance

4-49. Surveillance is  the  systematic  observation  of  aerospace,  cyberspace,  surface,  or  subsurface  areas, places,  persons,  or  things  by  visual,  aural,  electronic,  photographic,  or  other  means  (JP  3-0).  Surveillance involves observing an area to collect information and monitoring civilians and threats in a named area of interest or  target  area of  interest.  Surveillance  may  be  autonomous  or part of  a  reconnaissance  mission. Collecting information in cyberspace and the EMS as part of a surveillance mission is also called network surveillance. Network Surveillance is the observation of organizational, social, communications, cyberspace, or infrastructure  connections  and  relationships  (FM  2-0).  Network  surveillance  can  also  include  detailed

information on connections and relationships among individuals, groups, and organizations, and the role and importance of aspects of physical or virtual infrastructure.

4-50. Information collected through network surveillance and other surveillance types are enablers to the IPB process. This collected information provides insight into enemy cyberspace and EW capabilities and assets. Upon request, the CEMA section supports the G-2 or S-2's surveillance efforts by requesting OCO support to employ cyberspace exploitation or by using EW assets to conduct electromagnetic reconnaissance to conduct surveillance  in  enemy  and  neutral  cyberspace  and  the  EMS.  Information  collected  through  cyberspace exploitation  and  electromagnetic  reconnaissance  includes  mission  and  operational  variables  such  as  terrain characteristics, enemy and friendly obstacles, and the disposition of enemy forces and civilians.

## Security Operations

4-51. Security  operations are  those  operations  performed  by  commanders  to  provide  early  and  accurate warning of enemy operations, to provide the forces being protected with time and maneuver space within which to react to the enemy and to develop the situation to allow commanders to effectively use their protected forces (ADP 3-90). Early and accurate warnings provide friendly forces with time and maneuverability to react and create an opportunity for the commander to employ force protection measures. Cyberspace defense, cyberspace security, and EP include actions that allow early detection and mitigation of threats in cyberspace and the EMS. Additionally, ES missions conduct electromagnetic reconnaissance to attain information about the disposition of enemy threats in the EMS and modify security efforts.

4-52. The ultimate goal of security operations is to collect information on an enemy's COA that provide early warning and continuously disrupt enemy attacks. During security operations, information collected on an enemy's  COA  in  cyberspace  and  the  EMS  allows  units  to  take  preemptive  measures  that  prevent  enemy intelligence,  surveillance,  and  reconnaissance  assets  from  determining  friendly  locations,  strengths,  and weaknesses. Security operations also present opportunities to identify HVTs for future cyberspace attacks or EA.

Note. For more intelligence information, see FM 2-0. For more details of information collection, see FM 3-55.

## TERRAIN ASPECTS

4-53. Key terrain is any locality, or area, the seizure or retention of which affords a marked advantage to either force (JP 2-01.3). Key terrain in cyberspace and the EMS is comparable to terrain in the other domains in  that  prevailing  affords  any  combatant  a  position  of  advantage.  Maintaining  a  secured  prevalence  in cyberspace and the EMS is a feasible objective when conducting cyberspace operations and EW. Seizing and retaining  the  entirety  of  cyberspace  and  the  EMS  to  the  exclusion  of  all  enemies  and  adversaries  is  an unobtainable  goal.  It  is  also  possible  for  both  friendly  and  enemy  forces  to  occupy  the  same  terrain  in cyberspace and the EMS or use the same processes for conducting operations in and through cyberspace and the EMS without knowing each other's presence. Another characteristic of terrain in cyberspace is that virtual components,  identified  in  the  logical  network  layer  or  the  cyber-persona  layer,  constitutes  locality  in cyberspace. For this reason, identification of key cyberspace terrain is an essential component of planning cyberspace operations. Like the physical domain, commanders and staff must consider all of the military aspects of terrain. However, unlike the physical domain, commanders and staff must remember that the cyberspace terrain  may  change  at  any  time.  For  example,  an  attacker  may  manipulate  a  firewall  to  create  avenues  of approach, or the enemy removing a node from the network may be a key terrain.

4-54. Obstacles in cyberspace may include firewalls and port blocks. Avenues of approach in cyberspace can be analyzed to identify nodes and links that connect endpoints to specific sites. Cover and concealment may include hiding IP addresses or incorporating password-protected access to networks and network systems. Cyberspace observation and fields of fire include areas where network traffic can be monitored, intercepted, or recorded.  Key  cyber  terrain  provides  access  points  to  major  lines  of  communications,  key  waypoints  for observing  incoming  threats,  launch  points  for  cyberspace  attacks  and  mission-relevant  cyberspace  terrain related to critical assets connected to the DODIN.

4-55. Obstacles  in  the  EMS  may  include  electromagnetic  environmental  effects,  enemy  deployment  of sensors and radars to detect friendly use of the EMS, and enemy employment of electromagnetic hardening, masking,  and  security  measures.  Avenues  of  approach  in  the  EMS  can  be  analyzed  to  identify  spectrumdependent  systems,  devices,  and  associated  infrastructures  that  connect  endpoints  to  specific  locations (precision geolocation). Cover and concealment can include emission control or the implementation of such electromagnetic masking techniques as low-observability, low probability of intercept, and low probability of detection. EMS fields of fire include those areas in the EMS where enemy electromagnetic energy can be detected, identified, and evaluated through electromagnetic reconnaissance.

4-56. Key  terrain  in  the  EMS  includes  frequencies  used  as  access  points  and  launch  points  to  enemy spectrum-dependent systems, devices, and associated infrastructures. Key terrain also includes frequencies used for preemptive countermeasures, observing incoming threats, and critical assets dependent on the EMS. Key physical terrain is also imperative to the success of EW operations. Key terrain that provides superior line of sight  over  the  adversary's  position  will  help  ensure  friendly  forces  maintain  a  marked  advantage  over  the adversary.

4-57. Members of the CEMA working group need to match mission objectives with terrain analysis during planning to determine key terrain in friendly, neutral, and enemy cyberspace (See Appendix A). Correlating objectives  with  key  terrain  ensures  mission  dependencies  in  cyberspace  and  the  EMS  are  identified  and prioritized for protection. The results from interdependent systems, networks, and infrastructure that support a mission objective may require in-depth analysis to develop customized risk management.

## TARGETING

4-58. Targeting is the process of selecting and prioritizing targets and matching the appropriate response to them,  considering  operational  requirements  and  capabilities  (JP  3-0).  A target is  an  entity  or  object  that performs a function for the adversary considered for possible engagement or other actions. (JP 3-60).

4-59. When targeting for cyberspace effects, the physical network layer is the medium through which all digital data travels. The physical network layer includes wired (land and undersea cable), and wireless (radio, radio-relay, cellular,  satellite)  transmission  means.  The  physical  network  layer  is  a  point  of  reference  used during targeting to determine the geographic location of an enemy's cyberspace and EMS capabilities.

4-60. When targeting, planners may know the logical location of some targets without knowing their physical location. The same is true when defending against threats in cyberspace. Defenders may know the logical point of origin for a threat without necessarily knowing the physical location of that threat. Engagement of logical network layer targets can only occur with a cyberspace capability.

4-61. The logical network layer provides target planners with an alternate view of the target that is different from the physical network layer. A target's position in the logical layer is identified by its IP addresses. Targets located by their IP address depict how nodes in the physical layer correlate to form networks in cyberspace. Targeting in the logical layer requires the IP address and access to the logical network to deliver cyberspace effects.  The  ability  of  adversaries  to  change  logical  layer  network  configurations  can  complicate  fires  and effects against both logical and cyber-persona layer targets, but the operational benefit of affecting those targets often outweigh targeting challenges.

4-62. The inability to target a cyber-persona in a distinct area or form in the physical and logical network layers presents unique complexities. Because of these complexities, target positioning at the cyber-persona layer often requires multiple intelligence collection methods and an extensive analysis to develop insight and situational  understanding  to  identify  actionable  targets.  Like  the  logical  network  layer,  cyber-personas  can change quickly compared to changes in the physical network layer.

4-63. EA  is  exceptionally  well  suited  to  attack  spectrum-dependent  targets  that  are  difficult  to  locate physically, cannot be accurately targeted for lethal fires, or require only temporary disruption. The fires support element plans, prepares, executes, and assesses fires supporting current and future operations by integrating coordinated lethal and nonlethal effects through the targeting process. Lethal and  nonlethal effects include indirect fires, air and missile defense, joint fires, cyberspace attacks, and EA.

4-64. Targeting is a multidiscipline effort that requires coordinated interaction among the commander, the fires  support  element,  and  several  staff  sections  that  form  the  targeting  working  group.  The  commander

prioritizes fires to the targeting working group and provides clear and concise guidance on effects expected from all fires, including cyberspace attacks and EA. Priority of fires is the commander's guidance to the staff, subordinate commanders, fires planners, and supporting agencies to employ fires in accordance with the relative importance of the unit's mission (FM 3-09). The targeting working group determines which targets to engage and how, where, and when to engage them based on the targeting guidance and priorities of the commander.

4-65. The targeting working group assigns lethal and nonlethal capabilities, including cyberspace attack and EA capabilities, to produce the desired effect on each target, ensuring compliance with the rules of engagement. The  CEMA  section  participates  in  the  targeting  working  group  and  provides  recommendations  for  the employment  of  cyberspace  and  EMS-related  actions  against  targets  to  meet  the  commander's  intent  and inclusion in the scheme of fires. Scheme of fires is  the detailed, logical sequence of targets and fire support events to find and engage targets to accomplish the supported commander's objectives (JP 3-09).

4-66. The CEMA section works closely with the fires support element to coordinate and manage cyberspace and EW assets as part of the fire support plan. This process is called fire support coordination and is the planning and executing of fire so that targets are adequately covered by a suitable weapon or group of weapons (JP 309).

## TARGETING FUNCTIONS

4-67. The  G-2  or  S-2,  in  collaboration  with  the  CEMA  section  and  the  fires  support  element,  detects, identifies, and locates targets through target acquisition. Effective employment of weapons, including EA and cyberspace attacks, require sufficient intelligence gained through target acquisition. The G-2 or S-2 conducts information  collection  to  provide  the  fires  support  element,  members  of  the  targeting  working  group,  and members of the targeting board with intelligence information used for targeting. This information includes threat cyberspace and EMS-enabled capabilities that require an individual or combined effect from lethal or nonlethal attacks.

4-68. Targeting occurs continuously throughout operations. Army targeting methodology consists of four functions: decide, detect, deliver, and assess (D3A). These targeting functions occur throughout the operations process. Commanders and staff should also be conversant with joint targeting methodology and understand how each of these processes and methodologies relate, because cyberspace operations and EW are usually coordinated by a joint force commander. Table 4-1, page 4-13, illustrates a crosswalk between the operations process, the joint targeting cycle, D3A, and military decision-making process.

## Decide

4-69. The decide function is the first step of the targeting process. It begins with the military decision-making process and continues throughout an operation. The CEMA section conducts the following actions during the decide function of targeting--

-  Threat cyberspace and EW-related capabilities and characteristics during target value analysis to identify high-value targets. A high-value target is a target the enemy commander requires for the successful completion of the mission (JP 3-60).
-  Identifying potential cyberspace and EW-related HPTs. A high-payoff target is a target whose loss to the enemy will significantly contribute to the success of the friendly course of action (JP 3-60). A high-payoff target is a high-value target that must be acquired and successfully engaged for the success of the commander's mission.
-  Specific targets that should be acquired and engaged using a cyberspace attack or EA capability and established target selection standards.
-  Location and time that targets are likely to be found through intelligence operations and how long the target will remain fixed.
-  Surveillance, reconnaissance, and target acquisition objectives for targets receiving cyberspace attacks or EA and determining if the unit has the necessary cyberspace attack or EA capabilities to deliver appropriate effects.
-  Cyberspace and EMS-related IRs essential to the targeting effort.
-  When, where, and with what priority should the targets be engaged, and what cyberspace attack or EA capability to employ for effects.
-  The  level  of  effectiveness  that  constitutes  a  successful  cyberspace  attack  or  EA  and  if  the engagement achieved the commander's objective.
-  If a cyberspace attack or EA can affect a target, and how and what type of cyberspace attack or EA can create the desired effect.
-  How to obtain the information needed to assess a cyberspace attack or EA to determine success or failure, and who will receive and process it.
-  Who will be the decision-making authority to determine the success or failure of a cyberspace attack or EA?
-  What contingency action will occur if a cyberspace attack or EA is unsuccessful, and who has the authority to direct those actions?
-  Identifying the unit's EW assets available for tasking and begin drafting FRAGOS.
-  Drafting the RFS for OCO support to meet targeting requirements.
-  Collaborating  with  units  at  higher,  lower,  and  adjacent  echelons  for  EW  support  to  satisfy identified gaps in EW capabilities.

## Deliver

4-74. The deliver function of the targeting process executes the target engagement guidance and supports the  commander's  battle  plan  upon  confirmation  of  the  location  and  identity  of  HPTs.  Close  coordination between  the  CEMA  section,  intelligence,  and  fires  support  element  is  critical  when  detecting  targets  and

-  Drafting the Joint Tactical Air Request for airborne EA and other necessary EW requesting forms, if required.
-  Open  communications  with  the  higher  command  to  receive  updates  on  whether  anticipated cyberspace attack and EA-related targets have been validated and added to the JTF headquarters' joint target list.
-  Discussing  cyberspace  and  EW-related  risk  that  the  commander  will  use  to  make  risk determinations.
-  Determining the level of authorities for the engaging targets using cyberspace and electromagnetic attacks.

4-70. During the decide function, the targeting working group identifies target restrictions that prohibit or restrict cyberspace attacks or EA on specified targets without approval from higher authorities. The sources of these restrictions include military risk, the law of war, rules of engagement, or other considerations. The JTF annotates entities within the AO prohibited from attack on the no-strike list and targets with restrictions on the restricted target list.

## Detect

4-71. The detect function of the targeting process is the second step of the targeting process; during this step ES capabilities or other target acquisition assets locate and track a specified target to the required level of accuracy in time and space. During the detect function, the G-2 or S-2 coordinates with the targeting working group in developing the information collection plan. Before conducting the deliver function, the targeting team must establish  measures of performance and measures of effectiveness for cyberspace and electromagnetic attacks to ensure they meet the commander's objectives.

4-72. The targeting working group focuses on the surveillance effort by identifying named areas of interest and target areas of interest integrated into the information collection plan. Named areas of interest are typically selected to capture indications of adversary courses of action but may be related to conditions of the OE.

4-73. The targeting working group identifies HPTs during planning and war-gaming. Target areas of interest that require specific engagements using cyberspace attack or EA capabilities differ from engagement areas. An engagement area is an area of concentration where a commander employs all available weapons to engage a target.  In  contrast,  a  target  area  of  interest  engagement  uses  a  specific  weapons  system  to  engage  a  target. During the detect function, the CEMA section conducts the following actions-

-  Provides  cyberspace  and  EW-related  IRs  to  determine  HPTs  that,  when  validated  by  the commander, are added to the priority intelligence requirement.
-  Tasks  EW  assets,  when  required,  to  conduct  electromagnetic  reconnaissance  to  support information collection.
-  Updates cyberspace attack and EA-related HVTs and HPTs.
-  Determines if identified targets can be affected using OCO or EA (or both), and what type of EA capability can create the desired effect

Note. The CEMA section alone cannot determine the type of cyberspace attack capability to use on  targets.  The  CEMA  section  must  coordinate  with  higher  headquarters  CEMA  staff  and appropriate joint cyberspace entities to develop an understanding of availability, feasibility, and suitability of specific cyberspace capabilities.

-  Advocating  for  the  nomination  of  cyberspace  attack  and  EA-related  targets  to  the  JTF headquarters' joint integrated prioritized target list and the joint targeting cycle.
-  Developing the RFS for OCO support.

delivering  cyberspace  attacks  and  EA.  The  fire  support  coordinator  or  fire  support  officer  details  fires coordination in the OPLAN or OPORD or target synchronization matrix.

## Assess

4-75. The assess function occurs throughout the operations process. During the assess function, targets are continuously refined and adjusted by the commander and staff in response to new or unforeseen situations presented  during  operations.  Combat  assessment  measures  the  effectiveness  of  cyberspace  attack  and  EA capabilities on the target and concludes with recommendations for reattack, continued attack, or to cease an attack.  Recommendations  for  reattack,  continued  attack,  and  ceasing  EA  are  combined  G-3  or  S-3  and intelligence functions approved by the commander. For more information on the targeting cycle and target development process, see ATP 3-60.

## CONSIDERATIONS WHEN TARGETING

4-76. The fires support element, in collaboration with the G-3 or S-3 and G-2 or S-2, uses targeting cycles and target development processes to select, prioritize, determine the type of effects, and duration of effects on targets. CEMA's planning, integrating, synchronizing, and assessing cyberspace operations and EW becomes apparent during the targeting process. Three important aspects of cyberspace and EW operations that require consideration during targeting processes are-

-  Characteristics of cyberspace and electromagnetic warfare capabilities.
-  Cascading, compounding, and collateral effects.
-  Reversibility of effects.
-  Considerations when requesting OCO support for targeting.

## CHARACTERISTICS OF CYBERSPACE AND ELECTROMAGNETIC WARFARE CAPABILITIES

4-77. Cyberspace capabilities are developed based on gathered intelligence and from operational and mission variables attained regarding an OE. In cyberspace operations, cyberspace forces consider such conditions as the type of computer operating system used by an enemy or adversary, the make and model of the hardware, the version of software installed on an enemy or adversary's computer, and the availability of cyberspace attack resources before creating effects on a target.

4-78. EW capabilities are also developed based on gathered intelligence on operational and mission variables attained regarding an EMOE. In EW, targeting planners compare the types and capabilities of known spectrumdependent devices that enemies use to the availability of EW resources before creating EW effects on a target. Targets include enemy spectrum-dependent devices carried by personnel and spectrum dependent systems used with or in weapons systems, sensory systems, facilities, and cyberspace capabilities that require the use of the EMS.

## CASCADING, COMPOUNDING, AND COLLATERAL EFFECTS

4-79. The  CEMA  section  should  understand  the  overlaps  amongst  the  military,  other  government, corporations,  and  private  sectors  in  cyberspace.  These  overlaps  are  particularly  important  for  estimates  of possible  cascading,  compounding,  or  collateral  effects  when  targeting  enemy  and  adversary  cyberspace capabilities.  The  same  level  of  consideration  is  required  when  targeting  enemy  and  adversary  spectrumdependent devices in the EMS.

4-80. Cyberspace  capabilities  can  create  effects  beyond  the  geographic  boundaries  of  an  AO  and  a commander's area of interest. Employing cyberspace capabilities for attack or manipulation purposes within an area of interest require additional authorities beyond those given to a corps and below commander. Effects resulting from cyberspace attack operations can cause cascading effects beyond the targeted system that were not evident to the targeting planners. Cascading effects can sometimes travel through subordinate systems to attain access to the targeted system. Cascading effects can also travel through lateral or high-level systems to access a targeted system. Compounding effects are a gathering of various cyberspace effects that have interacted in ways that may have been either intended or unforeseen. Effects resulting from EA can cause cascading effects

in the EMS beyond enemy or adversary's spectrum-dependent devices, disrupting or denying friendly forces access to the EMS throughout the EMOE.

4-81. Collateral effects, including collateral damage, are the accidental cyberspace or EW effects of military operations on non-combatant and civilian cyberspace or EW capabilities that were not the intended target when implementing fires.

Note. Rules of Engagement or an operations order may limit cyberspace or EW operations to only those cyberspace or EW tasks that may result in no or minimal collateral effects. The CEMA spectrum manager must deconflict the joint restriction frequency list to mitigate EMI before all EW missions.

## REVERSIBILITY OF EFFECTS

4-82. Targeting planners must consider the level of control that they can exercise throughout each cyberspace and electromagnetic attack. Categorization of reversibility of effects are-

-  Operator reversible effects. These effects can be recalled, recovered, or terminated by friendly forces.  Operator  reversible  effects  typically  represent  a  lower  risk  of  undesired  consequences, including discovery or retaliation.
-  Non-operator reversible effects. These are effects that targeting planners cannot recall, recover, or terminate after execution. Non-operator reversible effects typically represent a higher risk of response from the threat or other undesired consequences and may require more coordination.

## Considerations When Requesting Offensive Cyberspace Operations for Targeting

4-83. The integration of OCO into the targeting process requires both long-term preparation and real-time mission planning during execution activities of the operations process. Due to target development and access to both OCO capabilities and access to an enemy in cyberspace, it is essential to emphasize the necessity for long-term preparation and planning of OCO for deliberate targets and effects.

4-84. When planning for OCO support to attack deliberate targets, the CEMA working group should consider the following:

-  Determine if the target is targetable using OCO. Generally, the only potential targets that receive effects  from  a  cyberspace  attack  are  actively  functioning  in  some  portion  of  the  information environment (data or information generation, processing, storage, communications, and digital data consumption or destruction).
-  Ensure the target has not already been nominated or on an existing targeting list. If it has not already been nominated or placed on a current targeting list, it will require nomination for further target development.
-  Consolidate all answered CCIRs and IRs. CCIRs and IRs may include such threat cyberspace intelligence as-links or nodes; associated hardware or software; specific software versions and configurations, communications protocol; physical or logical dependencies; or specific identifiers (IP address, machine access control address, international mobile subscriber identity, or phone numbers).
-  Determine if intelligence attained through the IPB also includes information necessary to tailor targeting  development  on  avenues  to  gain  access  to  an  enemy's  cyberspace  capabilities. Approaches  to  attain  access  to  an  enemy's  cyberspace  capabilities  include-telephony,  IP, embedded systems, and radio frequencies.
-  The CEMA section is responsible for providing regular updates on a combat mission team's ability to conduct OCO as well as provide updated information on the supported operation.

Note. Access to an enemy's cyberspace capability does not guarantee the success of an employed cyberspace attack. The combat mission team must tailor the capability to create the desired effect on an enemy's cyberspace capability.

## RISK MANAGEMENT

4-85. Risk management is the process to identify, assess, and control risks and make decisions that balance risk  cost  with  mission  benefits  (JP  3-0)  and  an  element  of  command  and  control.  Risk  is  the  exposure  of someone or something valued to danger, harm, or loss, and is inherent in all operations. The commander and staff conduct risk management throughout the operations process to identify and mitigate risks associated with hazards that can cause friendly and civilian casualties, damage or destruction of equipment, or otherwise impact mission effectiveness. Aspects of cyberspace defense and security operations and EP missions include risk mitigation measures as part of risk management.

4-86. Risk  management  is  integrated  into  planning  activities  and  continues  throughout  the  operations process. Risk management consists of the following steps:

-  Identify the hazards.
-  Assess the hazards.
-  Develop controls and make risk decisions.
-  Implement controls.
-  Supervise and evaluate.

4-87. The CEMA section, as with all staff elements, incorporate risk management into cyberspace operations and  EW-related  running  estimates  and  recommendations  to  mitigate  risk.  The  G-3/S-3  coordinates  risk management  amongst  all  staff  elements  during  the  operations  process. For  more  information  on  the  risk management process, see ATP 5-19.

## RISKS IN CYBERSPACE AND THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM

4-88. Risk is inherent in all military operations. When commanders accept risks, they create opportunities to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative and achieve decisive results. The willingness to incur risks is often the key to exposing an enemy's weaknesses that the enemy considers beyond friendly reach. Commanders assess and mitigate risks continuously throughout the operations process. Many risks to the DODIN-A come from enemies, adversaries, and insiders. Some threats are well equipped and well trained, while some are novices using  readily  available  and  relatively  inexpensive  equipment  and  software.  Army  users  of  the  DODIN  are trained on basic cyberspace security, focusing on the safe use of information technology and understanding common threats in cyberspace.

4-89. Risk  management  is  the  Army's  primary  decision-making  process  for  identifying  hazards  and controlling  risks.  The  process  applies  to  all  types  of  operations,  tasks,  and  activities,  including  cyberspace operations. The factors of mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil considerations provide a standardized methodology for addressing both threat and hazard-based risks. Risks associated with cyberspace operations fall into four major categories-

-  Operational risks.
-  Technical risks.
-  Policy risks.
-  Operations security risks.

## Operational Risks

4-90. Operational  risks  pertain  to  the  consequences  that  cyberspace  and  EMS  threats  pose  to  mission effectiveness.  Operational  consequences  are  the  measure  of  cyberspace  attack  and  EA  effectiveness. Cyberspace intrusions or attacks, and likewise in the EMS, can compromise networks, systems, and data, which can result in operational consequences such as injury or death of personnel, damage to or loss of equipment or property, degradation of capabilities, mission degradation, or even mission failure. Exfiltration of data from

Army networks by the enemy can undermine the element of surprise and result in loss of initiative. Enemy or adversary  forces  may  conduct  cyberspace  and  EMS  attacks  to  exposed  friendly  networks  and  capabilities, compromising future cyberspace attacks and cyberspace exploitation missions.

4-91. Friendly  forces  conducting  cyberspace  operations  and  EW  encounter  many  operational  risks. Commander and staff consider cascading effects because of employing cyberspace attacks and EA. The CEMA section ensures that the commander and staff understand the characteristics of the various cyberspace and EW capabilities  and  their  associated  effects.  The  CEMA  section  informs  the  commander  and  staff  of  the reversibility of effects resulting from cyberspace attacks and EA to understand that some effects are irreversible at  the  operator  level.  Attaining  an  understanding  of  the  characteristics,  cascading  effects,  and  reversibility effects  provide  a  commander  with  situational  awareness  and  in  determining  the  acceptable  risks  when conducting cyberspace operations and EW.

4-92. It is essential to consider risk management when conducting OCO and EA that could reveal friendly locations and intentions to an adversary prematurely. Some OCO or EA effects have a one-time use and once utilized cannot be effectively used again. OCO and EA may also create cascading effects that could hinder other operations.

4-93. Personal electronic device(s) such as smartwatches, smartphones, tablets, laptops, and gaming systems can  be  a  significant  OPSEC  vulnerability  to  friendly  cyberspace  and  EW  capabilities. The  CEWO  gathers understanding  surrounding  risks  associated  with  PEDs  from  the  G2  or  S2  and  OPSEC  and  makes recommendations to the commander regarding their usage in the organization.

## Technical Risks

4-94. Technical risks exist when there are exploitable vulnerabilities in systems on the DODIN-A, and there are threats that can exploit those vulnerabilities. Nearly every technical system within the Army is networked, resulting  in  a  vulnerability  in  one  system  compromising  other  connected  systems,  creating  a  shared vulnerability.  These  potentially  vulnerable  networked  systems  and  components  directly  impact  the  Army's ability to conduct operations. DCO mitigates risks by defending against specified cyberspace attacks, thereby denying the enemy's ability to take advantage of technical vulnerabilities that could disrupt operations.

4-95. Robust  information  systems  engineering  disciplines  result  in  chain  risk  management,  security, counterintelligence, intelligence, and hardware and software assurance that assist the leaders with managing technical risk. Friendly forces examine the technical risks when conducting cyberspace attacks to avoid making friendly networks vulnerable to enemy cyberspace counterattacks. The Army uses a layering approach, using these elements-

-  Antivirus and anti-malware programs.
-  Employing firewalls.
-  Updating firmware and patches.
-  Employing network intrusion detection and monitoring sensors.
-  Implementing both cybersecurity and physical security measures to mitigate technical risks.

4-96. The elements listed in paragraph 4-95 are essential defensive enablers when implemented effectively and updated regularly.

## Policy Risks

4-97. Policy risk pertains to authorities, legal guidance, and international law. Policies address cyberspace boundaries, authorities, and responsibilities. Commanders and decision makers must perform risk assessments and consider known probable cascading and collateral effects due to overlapping interests between military, civil, government, private, and corporate activities on shared networks in cyberspace. Policies, the United States Code (USC), the Uniform Code of Military Justice, regulations, publications, operation orders, and standard operating procedures all constitute a body of governance for making decisions about activities in cyberspace.

4-98. Policy risk includes considering international norms and practices, the effect of deviating from those norms,  and  potential  shifts  in  international  reputation  because  of  the  effects  resulting  from  a  cyberspace operation. Cyberspace attacks can be delivered through networks owned, operated, and geographically located within the sovereignty of  multiple governments. EA can also deliver effects that impact frequencies in the

spectrum owned and operated by commercial, government, and other neutral users. Therefore, it is vital to consider the legal, cultural, and political costs associated with using cyberspace and the EMS as avenues of approach.

4-99. Policy risks occur where policy fails to address operational necessity. For example, a policy emplaced that limits cyberspace operations, which results in low levels of collateral effects, can result in a unit constrained to cyberspace attacks that will not result in the desired outcomes necessary for mission success. A collateral effects analysis to meet policy limits is distinct from the proportionality and necessity analysis required by the law of  war.  Even  if  a  proposed  cyberspace  operation  is  permissible  after  a  collateral  effect's  analysis,  the proposed  cyberspace  operation  or  EW  mission  must  include  a  legitimate  military  objective  that  is  also permissible under the law of war.

4-100. Policy risk applies to risk management under civil or legal considerations. An OCO or EA mission may pose a risk to host nation civilians and non-combatants in an OE where a standing objective is to minimize collateral damage. During a mission, it may be in the Army's best interest for host nation populations to be able to perform day-to-day activities. Interruptions of public networks may present hazards to the DODIN-A and pose dangers to Army forces because of social impacts that lead to riots, criminal activity, and the emergence of insurgent opportunists seeking to exploit civil unrest.

## Operations Security Risks

4-101. Both cyberspace and the EMS provides a venue for OPSEC risks. The Army depends on cyberspace security  programs  and  training  to  prevent  or  mitigate  OPSEC  risks.  Commanders  emphasize  and  establish OPSEC programs to minimize the risks. OPSEC measures include actions and information on the DODIN and non-DODIN information systems and networks.  All  personnel  are  responsible  for  protecting  sensitive  and critical information. EP denies unauthorized access to information that an enemy intercept in the EMS through electromagnetic security operations. For more information on OPSEC, refer to AR 530-1 and ATP 3-13.3.

## KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

4-102. Knowledge management is the process of enabling knowledge flow to enhance shared understanding, learning,  and  decision  making  (ADP  6-0).  The  four  components  of  knowledge  management  are  people, processes, tools, and organizations. Knowledge management facilitates the transfer of knowledge among the commander,  staff,  and  forces  to  build  and  maintain  situational  awareness  and  enhance  organizational performance. Through knowledge management, information gets to the right personnel at the right time to facilitate decision making.

4-103. During knowledge management, the necessary cyberspace operations and EW-related information and tools from higher headquarters are provided to the CEMA working group in a timely enough manner to make decisions  during  mission  analysis  and  COA  development.  Through  the  knowledge  management  process, cyberspace  operations  and  EW-related  intelligence  received  through  information  collection  and  IO  is disseminated for decision making by the CEMA working group. The knowledge management steps are-

-  Assess.
-  Design.
-  Develop.
-  Pilot.
-  Implement.

4-104. The CEWO is responsible for establishing and overseeing the flow of all cyberspace operations and EW-related information throughout the headquarters staff, including higher and lower echelons. The CEWO is accountable for providing IRs to the G-2 or S-2 to attain essential information needed to understand cyberspace and the EMS within an OE. Information acquired from IRs is also crucial to the CEMA section's ability to appropriately integrate and synchronize cyberspace operations and EW with the operations process.

4-105. The CEMA section and collaborating staff provide meaning to operations by sharing both tacit and explicit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is what individuals know; a unique, personal store of knowledge gained from life experiences, training, and networks of friends, acquaintances, and professional colleagues (ATP 601.1). All members of the CEMA working group provide knowledge attained from years of operational and
