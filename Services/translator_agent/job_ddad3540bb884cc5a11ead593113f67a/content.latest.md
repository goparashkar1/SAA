## Toplines

Russian President Vladimir Putin remains committed to his theory of victory, which holds that Russia can outlast the West and Ukraine in a war of attrition, and his demand for Ukraine's full capitulation. Putin met with the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) and General Staff leadership, Federal Security Service (FSB) Head Alexander Bortnikov, and the commanders of the Russian groupings of forces on October 7 and claimed that Russian forces seized 4,900 square kilometers of territory in Ukraine so far in 2025 - roughly the size of Delaware.[1] ISW has observed evidence to assess that Russian forces have only seized 3,561 square kilometers in 2025. Putin claimed that Ukrainian forces are retreating along the entire line of contact and that the Russian defense industrial base (DIB) is meeting all the Russian military's weapons and equipment needs at an accelerated pace. Putin claimed that Russia remains committed to its goal of 'unconditionally' achieving all its objectives in the war. Russian Chief of the General Staff Army General Valery Gerasimov claimed that Russian forces are advancing in 'practically all directions' on the front.[2] Putin's and Gerasimov's claims are in line with Putin's long held theory of victory, which assumes that Russian forces will be able to continue gradual advances indefinitely, prevent Ukraine from conducting successful counteroffensive operations, and win a war of attrition against Ukrainian forces.[3] Putin continues to believe that the Russian military and economy can outlast and overcome Western support for Ukraine and Ukraine's own ability to continue defending against Russian aggression. Kremlin officials, including Putin, have repeatedly affirmed their dedication to achieving Russia's original war goals from 2021 and 2022.[4] Putin's public statements continue to demonstrate his unwillingness to engage in good-faith negotiations that result in anything less than full Ukrainian capitulation and his determination to protract the war to achieve his war aims on the battlefield.

Putin acknowledged Ukraine's long-range strike campaign against Russian oil refineries amidst ongoing gasoline shortages and price surges in Russia and occupied Ukraine. Putin stated on October 7 that Ukraine is striking deep into Russian territory but attempted to downplay the significance of Ukraine's strike campaign, claiming that it 'will not help.'[5] Putin stated that Russia's primary task is to ensure the safety of Russian civilians, strategic facilities, and energy infrastructure. Ukraine has intensified its strikes against Russian oil refineries, exacerbating gasoline shortages across Russia and occupied Ukraine and causing gasoline prices to skyrocket at the pump.[6] Russia is turning to Belarus to alleviate its limited gasoline supplies in Russia. Reuters reported on October 7 that industry sources stated that Belarus increased its rail-transported gasoline exports to Russia by four times monthon-month in September 2025.[7] Belarus reportedly exported 49,000 metric tons of gasoline or 14,500 barrels per day to the Russian domestic market and 33,000 tons of diesel fuel in September 2025.

A Kremlin-affiliated milblogger expressed concern about Ukraine's strike campaign and criticized the Kremlin's failure to protect Russia's energy infrastructure. The milblogger claimed on October 8 that Ukrainian forces are striking Russian oil infrastructure to maximize economic damage in Russia.[8] The milblogger claimed that Ukraine's demonstrated ability to target refineries 2,000 kilometers into Russian territory, which was previously outside of Ukrainian strike capability radius, raises concerns for Russia. The milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces are specifically targeting the electrical desalting units with atmospheric-vacuum tubes (ELOU-AVT) within the oil refineries, which the milblogger characterized as the 'heart' of the refineries that play a key role in processing and separating crude oil. The milblogger claimed that growing Ukrainian strike capabilities threaten infrastructure in Russia's deep rear and are especially concerning given Russia's dependency on energy prices to fund its war in Ukraine. The milblogger called on Russian authorities to pay more attention to protecting energy infrastructure and criticized Russian authorities' attempts to shift responsibility for protecting oil refineries onto private businesses. Russian milbloggers have repeatedly complained throughout the war about the Kremlin's failure to adapt to repeated successful Ukrainian strikes and to construct protective shelters at critical infrastructure facilities.[9]

The Kremlin is intensifying its efforts to use defunct US-Russian arms control treaties to gain concessions from the United States on the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin is moving to withdraw from the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement (PMDA), with the Russian State Duma denouncing the agreement on October 8.[10] The PMDA committed the United States and Russia to disposing of at least 34 tons of their stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium, which is crucial for nuclear weapons production, left over from Cold War era nuclear warheads.[11] Russia and the United States agreed to the PMDA in 2000, and it entered into force in 2011.[12] Putin issued a decree suspending Russia's participation in the agreement in 2016, citing US sanctions against Russia, US laws supporting Ukraine, NATO's eastward expansion, and the claimed buildup of US forces in eastern Europe.[13] The Duma claimed that it denounced the PMDA on October 8 due to 'anti-Russian' steps from the United States that have changed the strategic balance that existed at the time of the agreement and that create threats to strategic stability.[14] Russia's Federation Council and Putin still need to approve the denunciation law, but the Kremlin has likely already decided to withdraw from the agreement.[15]

Russian officials largely blamed the United States for not adhering to the PMDA, likely in an effort to use the withdrawal from the agreement as blackmail for further concessions. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov claimed that Russia's continued adherence to the agreement's obligations is 'unacceptable' and 'inappropriate.'[16] Ryabkov claimed that the United States cannot meet any of Russia's conditions to resume the PMDA as the situation has 'radically changed.' Ryabkov claimed that the growing 'graveyard' of arms control agreements is due to destructive US policies that have 'discarded' the principles that underpinned strategic stability for several decades.[17] First Deputy Chairperson of the Duma Committee on International Affairs Vyacheslav Nikonov claimed that Russia and the United States can revisit the PMDA if the United States 'behaves well.'[18] First Deputy Chairperson of the Duma Defense Committee Alexei Zhuravlev claimed that the West is provoking an arms race such that Russia's adherence to old agreements would be 'foolish' since Russia 'should have the best weapons in the world.'[19] Duma Chairperson Vyacheslav Volodin claimed that those who want to exploit Russia must understand that this is not possible and that Russia should have terminated the PMDA long ago.[20]

The Duma's move toward withdrawing from the PMDA comes after Russia similarly withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in August 2025.[21] The United States suspended its participation in the INF Treaty in 2019 due to Russian violations, and Russia followed suit soon after. The

Kremlin's decisions about the PMDA have followed a similar pattern, with Putin signing the decree to suspend Russia's participation in the treaty in 2016, but Russia is only now moving to withdraw.[22] The Kremlin is likely resurrecting discussions about treaties that Russia suspended years ago in order to achieve political and informational effects that benefit Russia's war effort in Ukraine. Russia appears to be using a combination of carrots and sticks in these efforts, but both avenues aim to push the United States to turn its attention away from the war and toward US-Russian bilateral relations. Russia's withdrawals from arms treaties like the INF Treaty and PMDA aim to use the threat of an arms race to achieve this effect, whereas Russia's recent offer to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) for one year after its expiration in February 2026 aims to entice the United States with the prospect of renewed arms control talks.[23] The Kremlin appears to be shifting away from using promises of bilateral economic and financial deals to entice the United States, as the Kremlin did more frequently in the early months of 2025 after US President Donald Trump entered office.[24]

The Kremlin's moves to withdraw from PMDA likely immediately aim to prevent US sales of Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine and are part of an ongoing reflexive control campaign. The Kremlin continued on October 8 its reflexive control campaign aimed at influencing US decision-making on Tomahawk deliveries to Ukraine. Kremlin officials continued to claim that US personnel will have to directly participate in Ukrainian Tomahawk strikes and that the missiles will not affect Russia's determination to achieve its war goals or the situation on the battlefield.[25] Kremlin officials also responded to possible US deliveries of Tomahawks by threatening the United States. Kremlin newswire TASS amplified a claim from Alexander Stepanov from the Institute of Law and National Security at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration that the Duma's ratification of Russia's military cooperation agreement with Cuba is Russia's 'symmetrical' response to possible Tomahawk deliveries.[26] Stepanov claimed that Russian supplies of Iskander and Oreshnik ballistic missiles to Cuba would be a justified response. Stepanov's claims come against the backdrop of Belarusian Defense Minister Lieutenant General Viktor Khrenin's October 8 meeting in Belarus with Cuban Chief of the General Staff and First Deputy Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces Roberto Legra Sotolongo.[27] ISW continues to assess that the Kremlin is pursuing various multi-pronged information efforts to deter the United States from selling Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine.[28] Russia's October 8 withdrawal from the PMDA likely aims to reinforce the Kremlin's efforts to frame US-Russian relations as entering a dangerous stage and to divert US attention from Ukraine to bilateral relations and arms control talks.

The Russian military command reportedly redeployed elements of the 41st Combined Arms Army (CAA, Central Military District [CMD]) from south of Pokrovsk to the Novopavlivka direction, which will likely improve Russia's command and control (C2) in both sectors. An open-source analyst on X (formerly Twitter) reported on October 8 that the Russian military command redeployed elements of the 35th, 55th, 74th, and 137th separate motorized rifle brigades (all four of the 41st CAA, CMD) from south of Pokrovsk to the Novopavlivka direction.[29] The X analyst reported that the entire 90th Tank Division (41st CAA) is now operating near Novopavlivka and Ivanivka (southwest of Novopavlivka) and that only elements of the 15th and 30th motorized rifle brigades (both of the 2nd CAA, CMD) and 27th Motorized Rifle Division (2nd CAA) remain south of Pokrovsk. ISW has observed reports that elements of the 1195th Separate Motorized Rifle Regiment (41st CAA) and 1452nd Motorized Rifle Regiment (reportedly of the 41st CAA) are operating in the Novopavlivka direction.[30] Elements of the 2nd CAA have been operating south and east of Pokrovsk since October 2023.[31] The reported redeployments of elements of the 41st CAA to the Novopavlivka direction indicates that almost all of the 41st CAA's units and formations are now operating in the area, which will likely streamline C2 in the area.[32] The decision to redeploy elements of the 41st CAA away from the area south of Pokrovsk while

keeping some elements of the 2nd CAA in the area will also likely streamline the 2nd CAA's C2 in the Pokrovsk direction.

The reason for the redeployment of elements of the 41st CAA is unclear at this time. The area east and south of Novopavlivka has been relatively less active recently compared to other areas of the front that Russia is prioritizing, although a Ukrainian military source suggested that Russian forces recently intensified the tempo of attacks in the area.[33] The Russian military command may be redeploying 41st CAA elements to allow them to rest and reconstitute away from more active sectors like the area near Pokrovsk. The redeployments may alternatively indicate that the Russian military command intends to intensify offensive operations in the Novopavlivka direction. Russian forces may aim to collapse the Ukrainian salient near Novopavlivka, level the frontline, and reduce the threat of Ukrainian counterattacks on Russia's flanks in the area. An intensification of Russian offensive operations near Novopavlivka would likely also aim to generate informational effects about deeper Russian advances into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The Russian military command may have reduced the force grouping south of Pokrovsk as it intends to deprioritize frontal assaults on Pokrovsk itself from the south, choosing instead to focus on efforts to envelop Pokrovsk from the north.

European officials continue to report drone sightings and GPS interference in European airspace . Lithuanian National Radio and Television (LRT) reported that GPS interference forced a Ryanair plane flying from Vienna, Austria, to Vilnius, Lithuania, on October 8 to abort its first landing attempt.[34] The pilot was able to land the plane after a subsequent landing attempt. Alain Quevrin, the country director for arms manufacturing company Thales Belgium, stated on October 8 that the company has seen an increased number of drones flying over its top-secret facilities as compared to a few months ago.[35] Quevrin reported that drones have flown over the company's site in Liege, the only Belgian facility that assembles and stores 70mm rockets.[36] Ukrainian forces notably use Thales 70mm rockets. European officials have yet to attribute the GPS interference or drone sightings to Russia. Russia has engaged in a multipronged campaign against Europe since at least 2022 that has included drone incursions into European airspace, GPS jamming of planes flying over eastern Europe, and sabotage operations targeting Europe's defense industrial base (DIB).[37]

European officials continued to warn that Russia's recent drone attacks against Europe are part of a broader campaign to generate fear and disunity in Europe. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated on October 8 that recent drone incursions into European airspace are part of a 'deliberate and targeted' campaign to unsettle European citizens.[38] Von der Leyen stated that one or two drones in European airspace could be a 'mistake' or 'coincidence' but that three to ten incursions constitute a pattern.[39] Von der Leyen stated that Russia is using the incursions to try to sow division among European states.[40] ISW continues to assess that Russia's increased covert and overt attacks against Europe indicate that Russia has entered 'Phase 0' - the informational and psychological condition setting phase - of its campaign to prepare for a possible NATO-Russia war in the future.[41] Russia also likely aims to pressure Europe to decrease its support for Ukraine out of fear that continued support will increase Russia's attacks.[42]

We do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.

Russian forces attacked in Kursk and Sumy oblasts, including northwest of Sumy City near Novyi Put and Bezsalivka, north of Sumy City near Oleksiivka, and northeast of Sumy City near Yunakivka and Varachyne, on October 7 and 8.[44] Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces counterattacked near Oleksiivka and Novomykolaivka (north of Sumy City).[45]

A Russian milblogger reportedly affiliated with the Northern Grouping of Forces claimed that Russian forces are facing issues with supplies near Bezsalivka and Yunakivka and that Russian forces are facing heavy losses near Novyi Put.[46] The milblogger claimed that Ukrainian drones are preventing Russian forces from penetrating Ukrainian lines in Novyi Put and that Russian forces are accumulating forces for attacks on Ryzhivka (northwest of Sumy City).[47] The milblogger claimed that Russian airborne (VDV) forces left Bezsalivka without fully clearing the settlement and that only one company from the 1st Battalion of the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) entered the settlement after three VDV companies left.[48] The milblogger claimed that elements of the 1st Battalion suffer casualties daily and receive no artillery support. The milblogger claimed that Russian forces cannot enter Bezsalivka as Ukrainian forces control the nearby windbreaks (likely referring to fire control) and are relying on drones for supplies. The milblogger claimed that elements of the 3rd Battalion of the Russian 30th Motorized Rifle Regiment (72nd Motorized Rifle Division, 44th Army Corps [AC], Leningrad Military District [LMD]) and elements of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade (Black Sea Fleet) are operating near Oleksiivka but that the 3rd Battalion of the 30th Motorized Rifle Regiment only has roughly 70 soldiers remaining and is suffering heavy losses.[49] The milblogger claimed that elements of the 30th Motorized Rifle Brigade often attack 'in a herd,' whereas elements of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade 'carefully' attack in small groups and suffer a reduced number of losses.

A Russian milblogger and former Storm-Z instructor claimed that Russian reinforcements in the

Dobropillya penetration area are mostly composed of older recruits who are incapable of walking 15 kilometers to the frontline while carrying supplies and under Ukrainian drone strikes.[75] The milblogger claimed that the main reinforcements in the area are composed of soldiers who went absent without leave (AWOL) but whom Russian authorities captured, and that the reinforcements often refuse to conduct assaults. The milblogger claimed that issues with Russian crowdfunding efforts and volunteer support, rising prices, and growing materiel losses are making it difficult for Russian forces to provide drone support to assault groups, conduct drone reconnaissance, and adjust fires.
