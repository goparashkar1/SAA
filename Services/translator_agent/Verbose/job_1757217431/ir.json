Ransom notes appeared from \n“HomeLand Justice,” but it was clear the attackers were not Albanian. The attackers collected \nand then either deleted or leaked classified information, including the identities of undercover \nintelligence officers and emails from the director of intelligence. As Foreign Policy put it at the \ntime: “all aspects of the lives of Albanian citizens, from births to marriages to deaths, were thrown \ninto disarray.”1\nIran, angry at Albania’s hosting of an Iranian opposition group that it classifies as a terrorist \norganization, had used an intensive cyberattack to coerce and punish the country. Though Albania’s \nsystems largely were restored within weeks, Iran hit Tirana again in September 2022 and a third \ntime in December 2023. By the December attack, Albania had learned hard lessons and was resilient \nenough to avoid severe consequences.2\nIran can fairly be described as a rising, aggressive cyber actor. Persistent cyber operations for \ndomestic surveillance as well as years of constant confrontation with Israel and Saudi Arabia have \ngiven Tehran significant experience in this domain. Two key events catalyzed Iran’s cyber focus: \n(1) a set of regime-threatening protests in 2009 called the Green Movement, and (2) the discovery \nof the Stuxnet virus, which targeted Iran’s nuclear program.3 More recently, Iran has shown a \nwillingness to escalate dramatically and to engage in high-profile attacks. In addition to the attack \non Albania in 2022, for instance, Iran attempted to interfere in the 2020 and 2024 U.S. elections and \nattacked water infrastructure in the United States in 2013 and again in 2023.4",

          "text": "Julia Dickson and Emily Harding  |  3\nIn the wake of the Green Movement, also known as “Iran’s Twitter Revolution,” Tehran found \nit necessary to develop cyber capabilities in order to maintain the strength of the regime. As \nmillions of Iranians took to the streets to protest the presidential elections, protestors also \ngathered on social media sites and conducted distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against \ngovernment websites.5 According to analysis by the Carnegie Endowment for International \nPeace, the government became acutely aware that the internet “could be used as an instrument \nof mass mobilization and represented a significant challenge to the regime’s long-held \ninformation monopoly.”6\nIn response to the protests, the regime developed tools to control its domestic cyberspace and \nsurveil its population. Government-affiliated groups defaced websites associated with the political \nopposition, Israeli businesses, and social media sites. Official government groups also conducted \nDDoS attacks against critical websites and spied on government critics. The surveillance and \ncensorship eventually paralyzed the Green Movement, and the strategy, tools, and threat actors that \ndeveloped during this period laid the groundwork for Iran’s modern cyber operations.7\nLikewise, the discovery of the Stuxnet attack may have encouraged Tehran’s development of \noffensive, retaliatory tools. Stuxnet, a series of exploits that infected Iran’s nuclear facilities around \n2009, caused not only digital problems but also physical damage. Centrifuges, in particular, seem \nto have been affected by the code.8 Not long after, in 2011, Iran launched attacks against at least \nsix big American banks and a small dam in New York.9 The country then hit Saudi Aramco, the \nlargest Saudi oil company, in 2012, destroying an estimated 35,000 computers.10 Since then, Iranian \nhackers have conducted thousands of cyberattacks, primarily against Israel, the United States, \nand Saudi Arabia.11\nTehran has committed millions of dollars to developing its cyber capabilities. According to a report \nby the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, “some 18 percent of Iranian \nuniversity students were reportedly studying computer science” by the late 2010s and “Iran’s cyber \nbudget jumped twelvefold between 2013–2021.”12 The regime uses compulsory military service to \nchannel these technologically knowledgeable graduates into the state security apparatus, including \nthe two components best known for carrying out cyberattacks: the Islamic Revolutionary Guard \nCorps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence ( ).13\nCooperation with other countries has also contributed to Iran’s cyber capabilities. Tehran and \nMoscow have signed numerous cyber cooperation agreements, starting with a preliminary \nagreement in 2015.14 In 2017, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding for \ncooperation on information technology and communications-related issues, including “internet \ngovernance [and] network security.”15 Further, they signed an updated agreement in 2021 to \nshare information related to “the fight against crimes committed with the use of information and \ncommunications technology,” which includes cooperation in detecting cyber intrusions, technology \ntransfer, and combined training.16 Moscow is also supplying Tehran with technology. For example, \nin 2023, the Kremlin provided Tehran with powerful communications-surveillance capabilities and \nadvanced software for hacking dissidents’ systems and phones.17",

In 2021, the two countries signed \na 25-year strategic agreement, which was leaked on social media and published by Iranian news \nsites. It includes both military and cybersecurity cooperation, and as part of this agreement, \nBeijing will help Tehran build its 5G telecommunications infrastructure and assert greater control \nover its cyberspace by sharing knowledge and technologies related to digital surveillance and \nonline censorship.18\nWhile Tehran is rapidly improving its cyber capabilities, they somewhat lag behind other advanced \ncyber actors. In 2017, an Israeli general assessed that Iran is “not state of the art” nor the “strongest \nsuperpower in the cyber dimension,” but is nonetheless quickly improving its cyber capabilities.19 \nIranian leaders are known to oversell the nation’s offensive cyber capabilities as part of their \nmilitary propaganda, and Tehran lacks an advanced and organized security apparatus, so the \nmost sophisticated kinds of cyberattack (such as Stuxnet or the Russian actions in Ukraine) are still \nbeyond Iranian capabilities.20\nAlthough Tehran is not yet as advanced as Russia or China, the United States and its allies should \nnot underestimate this adversary. Tehran has demonstrated a brazen willingness to attack civilian \ncritical infrastructure and will likely continue to reach for destructive tools. Poorly defended targets \nin the United States (of which there are many) are vulnerable; they include smaller banks or local \npower companies, or poorly secured pipeline control systems. Further, Iran conflates Israel and \nthe United States, viewing the latter as a legitimate target in retaliation for Israeli actions. As the \n2023 Annual Threat Assessment from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence states: “Iran’s \ngrowing expertise and willingness to conduct aggressive cyber operations make it a major threat to \nthe security of the U.S. and allied networks and data.”21\nAlthough Tehran is not yet as advanced as Russia or China, \nthe United States and its allies should not underestimate this \nadversary.

In developing its offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, the country has \ntwo main goals: (1) to create a “technological envelope” to protect its critical and sensitive \ninfrastructure from cyberattacks, and (2) to counter adversaries in cyberspace.22 Central to \nthe second goal is “forward defense,” a concept holding that militarily confronting adversaries \noutside of Iran’s borders is preferable to fighting them within Iran.23 Offensive cyber operations \nare an important component of this hybrid strategy, suggesting that Iran will continue to invest in \ndeveloping its cyber capabilities.24\nThis section will cover several key features of Iran’s cyber strategy: sophisticated social engineering \ncampaigns to gain access to networks, cyber-enabled influence operations, disruptive and \ndestructive attacks, and the use of proxies to carry out these various methods of attack.\nAs part of their cyber operations, Iranians have become particularly adept at crafting sophisticated \nsocial engineering campaigns. According to a 2022 report by Insikt Group, Iranian hackers are \ncapable of social engineering in ways that are similarly as advanced as Russia’s advanced persistent \nthreat (APT) groups, demonstrating the capability to understand and dissect foreign societies, \npolitical systems, and languages. Iranian APTs “use many of the studied ‘principles of influence’ \nand overlap with human intelligence (HUMINT) recruitment processes” to target their victims.

The APT friended the victim \non Facebook in 2019, if not before, and actively had conversations with the victim on both \ncorporate and personal communication platforms in 2020. In early June 2021, Imperial \nKitten delivered a malicious email in an attempt to infect the victim’s system with malware. \nIn mid-July, Facebook announced that it removed a network of fake users, including Marcella \nFlores, from its platform.27 \n  \t\n▪\nIsrael’s Shin Bet internal intelligence agency announced in late July 2023 that Iranian hackers \ncreated fake LinkedIn profiles and initiated conversations with Israeli citizens, specifically \ncivil servants and researchers, eventually moving to email. The Israeli agency managed to \nthwart the campaign.28\nAnother key component of Iran’s recent cyber strategy is the use of cyber-enabled influence \noperations. These operations have become significantly more common since mid-2022 and surged \nin particular as the Israel–Hamas conflict broke out in October 2023. They “combine offensive \ncomputer operations with messaging and amplification in a coordinated and manipulative fashion \nto shift [victims’] perceptions, behaviors, or decisions” and further the regime’s strategic objectives, \naccording to Microsoft.29 Tactics include leaking sensitive data to undermine public trust in \ninstitutions and posting hacked material to social media pages to drive fear in Iranian adversaries \nand boast about Iran’s capabilities.

Iran also \nuses this technique against Israel’s allies to undermine support for Israel’s military campaigns.31 In \none instance, Emennet Pasargad, an Iranian-state-affiliated front company, interrupted multiple \nbroadcast channels in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The front \ncompany accessed the news stations’ internal networks and used this access to broadcast their own \ncontent. Their video began with an AI-generated newscaster reading a message saying, “We had no \nchoice but to deliver this to you,” before showing unverified graphic images of Palestinians killed or \ninjured by the Israeli military.32\nIn early July 2024, then-Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines issued a formal statement \nabout Iranian influence operations directed at Americans. She warned:\nIn recent weeks, Iranian government actors have sought to opportunistically take advantage \nof ongoing protests regarding the war in Gaza, using a playbook we’ve seen other actors use \nover the years. We have observed actors tied to Iran’s government posing as activists online, \nseeking to encourage protests, and even providing financial support to protesters.33\nHaines also stated that Americans were protesting to express their authentic views on the war in \nGaza and highlighted that expressing those opinions is a core part of being a democracy.

In short, Tehran is predictably aggressive, but against \nunpredictable targets, and its attacks can range from feckless to highly destructive. In 2012, for \nexample, Tehran targeted one of the world’s largest oil companies, Saudi Aramco, using a phishing \nemail and a wiper to partially wipe or completely destroy an estimated 35,000 computers in a few \nhours. While the attack failed to impact oil production, it froze all payment systems and prevented \ngasoline tank trucks from processing payments. CNN reported in a deep dive on the attack that \n“Managing supplies, shipping, contracts with governments and business partners—all of that was \nforced to happen on paper. . . . After 17 days, the corporation relented and started giving oil away \nfor free to keep it flowing within Saudi Arabia” and to ensure the country had a sufficient supply as \nSaudi Aramco worked to bring the systems back online.34\nThe use of proxies and front organizations is another important component of Iranian strategy \nthat allows the country to maintain a level of plausible deniability. For instance, a group called \n“Cutting Sword of Justice” claimed responsibility for the attack on Saudi Aramco, citing it as an \nact of retaliation for supporting the Al Saud regime and its crimes and atrocities against citizens \nin Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt, amongst others. Iran denied any involvement in the attack, but U.S. \nintelligence attributed it to Tehran.35 For more about proxies and front organizations, see page 23.\nHow Cyber Strategy Fits into Foreign Policy\nIran views cyber as a cost-effective, low-risk tool for harassing its adversaries abroad. Iran uses \ncyberattacks as one tool in its asymmetric tool kit, enabling a less risky way to challenge nations that \nit could not compete with in a conventional armed conflict. Using cyber tools, Tehran can damage \nconventionally stronger opponents and quickly collect intelligence on a variety of strategically \nvaluable targets while maintaining a level of deniability. The intended outcomes of the attacks range \nfrom espionage and embarrassment of an adversary to real, lasting damage against an enemy that is \nconventionally stronger.36\nIran also uses cyber operations as a defense mechanism for maintaining stability at home, \nspecifically to ensure regime survival. Domestic surveillance is a strong focus of the regime’s cyber \noperations. Iranian threat actors, for example, frequently target current Iranian government \nofficials (such as diplomats) and their families as well as reformist politicians and journalists. Tehran \ncollects personal information and monitors the political and personal networks of these individuals \nwho are of strategic interest to the Iranian government. This allows the regime to watch for \npotential rivals and obtain sensitive information that can later be used for blackmail.37\nAnother key component of Tehran’s strategy is to control its domestic information space to prevent \nWestern values and culture from “corrupting” Iranian society. Iran views cyberspace as “a cultural \nbattlefield between Iran and the Western world.” The IRGC persistently blocks international news \nsites, social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, and other popular media sites such as",

According to the U.S. Department of \nthe Treasury, the NIN is “being used to disconnect the Iranian people from the global internet.”40 \nAs it will be completely under government control, the NIN, once operational, will allow the \ngovernment to keep critical infrastructure online when it imposes internet blackouts to silence \ncriticism. Such control is already evident; in 2019, as protests erupted over a petrol-rationing \nscheme that significantly raised oil prices, the Iranian government imposed an internet blackout \nthat cut access for most of the country for a week. Services such as banking transactions were able \nto continue, and local versions of other internet-based tools such as a navigation app and a search \nengine also remained online and even gained customers.41 When the NIN becomes fully operational, \nthe government will have full control over the information available to the Iranian population, \nlimiting the accessibility of foreign news and reducing Iran’s vulnerability to cyberattacks.42\nWhile many cyber intrusions are used to monitor and control the Iranian population and thus \nmaintain the strength of the regime, Iran also conducts destructive cyberattacks. Tehran notably \ndoes not make a discernible distinction between operations carried out against domestic and \nforeign adversaries. The same cyber tools developed and used against domestic organizations and \nIranian citizens have since been used against adversaries as disparate as the U.S. defense industry, \nPersian-language women’s development programs, and Saudi government institutions. The same \nthreat actors also target both domestic and international organizations and individuals.43\nThe same cyber tools developed and used against domestic \norganizations and Iranian citizens have since been used \nagainst adversaries as disparate as the U.S. defense industry, \nPersian-language women’s development programs, and Saudi \ngovernment institutions.

Tehran does not shy away from targeting civilian critical \ninfrastructure, having already attacked the financial sector, pipelines, dams, and water facilities, \nwhich “can enable actions that harm the public and cause devastating humanitarian consequences.”47 \nWhile Iran has increasingly turned to cyber operations as a tool in its tool kit for irregular conflict, \nTehran may not be ready to fully integrate cyber into active conflict operations. Tehran continues \nto support groups involved in conflicts in Gaza, Iraq, Yemen, and Syria, but cyber operations have \nnot featured in those wars. Part of the reason is likely the difficulty of executing tactical cyber \noperations, which requires intensive coordination and seamless communication. Instead, Iran has \ncontinued to pursue cyber-enabled influence operations and cyber operations on the margins of \nconflict. Although past attacks in these conflicts have not been particularly damaging, Tehran’s \nrapidly developing tool kit may lead to more destabilizing and escalatory attacks in the future.\nThroughout the war in Gaza, a complex Iranian influence campaign called Emerald Divide has \nsought to “psychologically manipulate Israeli citizens to take real-world actions that exacerbate \nideological divisions within Israeli society and undermine the Israeli government,” according to \nSean Minor, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Insikt Group.48 While Emerald Divide has been \noperational since at least 2021, the group has focused on the ongoing conflict in Gaza since the \nattacks on October 7, 2023. One such effort, the “Tears of War” Telegram channel, posts content \nrelated to the Hamas-captured hostages and Israeli victims to encourage Israelis to partake in \nanti-government protests and raise internal conflict.49 \nHow Iran Approaches Deniability\nTehran rarely claims responsibility for cyber operations and instead tends to emphasize its \ndefensive capabilities while touting claims of victimhood.50 Overall, Iran provides conflicting \ninformation about its offensive cyber operations—it simultaneously burnishes its capabilities while \nconsistently denying involvement in attacks.51\nJust as it does in other warfare domains, Tehran relies on proxies and front organizations to \nmaintain a degree of separation and plausible deniability, which emboldens the government to \nvehemently deny involvement in cyber operations. In general, the use of proxies has been a key \naspect of Iran’s military strategy since the Iranian Revolution. Tehran has a robust network of \nproxies such as Hezbollah and Hamas that it uses as channels for action in conflicts throughout \nthe Middle East.52 Similarly, Tehran conducts many of its cyber operations using cyber proxies that \ndisguise themselves as hacktivists or pan-Islamists. By doing so, Iran avoids definite attribution, \npreserving its claims of victimhood. However, cyber defenders have increasingly been able to \nidentify hallmarks of IRGC and MOIS campaigns.

          "text": "Julia Dickson and Emily Harding  |  11\nImplementation: Campaigns or Opportunism?\nWhile Iranian actors tend to be reactive, exploiting opportunities for cyberattacks as they arise, \nthey are patient and persistent in their social engineering campaigns. Many of Iran’s cyber efforts \nare designed to be splashy and public, both making a political statement and causing actual \ndamage. Those are generally presented as retaliatory attacks—activism attempting to right a social \nwrong. It is not clear, however, how far in advance Iran attempts to establish these accesses for \nlater exploitation. In other words, which comes first, the desire to retaliate or the capability, \nheld in reserve?\nFollowing Israel’s invasion of Gaza, Iran demonstrated its opportunistic tendencies to quickly react \nin support of Gaza. In one such attack, Malek Team, an Iranian actor likely associated with the \nMOIS, leaked personal data from an Israeli university. When publishing the data on Twitter, Malek \nTeam used hashtags to support Hamas and later shifted messaging to belittle Israeli prime minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu. The group either took advantage of any vulnerability it found quickly or \nrepurposed existing access to support its campaign against Israel, regardless of the relevance of the \ndata or victim to the conflict.53 For more information about Iranian attacks during the war in Gaza, \nsee the case study on page 36.\nSimilarly, the 2023 Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community highlighted that \n“Iran’s opportunistic approach to cyberattacks makes critical infrastructure owners in the United \nStates susceptible to being targeted by Tehran.”54 This warning came to fruition in November \n2023 when an Iranian cyber persona linked with the IRGC Cyber–Electronic Command targeted \na programmable logic controller manufactured by Unitronics (an Israeli company) at a water \nutility in Pennsylvania. The group, known as CyberAv3ngers, left a warning on the screen of the \ndevice: “Every equipment ‘made in Israel’ is CyberAv3ngers legal target.” While the water utility \nhas no intrinsic value to Iran, all poorly defended systems in adversary countries are potential \ntargets, allowing Tehran to engage with adversaries without spending a significant amount of time \ncarefully crafting a campaign. Even partially successful attacks that result in no significant damage \nor disruption of services are used in Iranian propaganda to further its strategic agenda.55 In this \ncase, the extent of the attackers’ access prompted the water facility managers to switch to manual \noperations out of concern that safety was compromised.\nU.S. election infrastructure is another critical sector that Tehran has targeted in furtherance of its \nstrategic goals. Similar to its initial attacks in support of Gaza, Iran’s 2020 campaign against U.S. \nelection systems attempted to advance Tehran’s long-term strategic goals—to undermine Americans’ \nfaith in the U.S. electoral system, sow discord in American society, and “undercut the reelection \nprospects of President Trump,” according to an unclassified report by the U.S. National Intelligence \nCouncil.56 A press release published by the U.S. Department of the Treasury stated that Iranian \nhackers attempted to compromise 11 state voter websites but were only successful in exploiting one. \nDespite failing 10 times, Tehran’s single success had the potential to spread fear and undermine \nfaith in electoral systems; it also allowed the country to download the personal information of over \n100,000 voters. Posing as a far-right group, hackers subsequently sent emails to tens of thousands \nof Democratic voters, including many whose data had been stolen from the successful attack,",

Mandiant Intelligence, for \ninstance, reported that to gain access to victims’ email accounts or install Android malware on their \nmobile devices, APT42 “uses highly targeted spear-phishing and social engineering techniques \ndesigned to build trust and rapport with their victims.”59 In May 2024, Mandiant reported that the \ngroup was “posing as journalists and event organizers . . . to deliver invitations to conferences \nor legitimate documents,” which allowed the APT to harvest credentials and gain access to \ncloud environments.60\nCybersecurity researchers have also witnessed increased collaboration between Iranian-state \naffiliated actors, suggesting a degree of pre-planning.

Since its establishment, the IRGC has \ntaken on an exceedingly large role in executing Iran’s foreign policy, particularly via Iran’s covert, \nasymmetric operations abroad. The IRGC has ties to regional armed groups, including Hezbollah \nin Lebanon, militant groups in Iraq, and Hamas in Gaza. It has considerable influence in domestic \npolitics as well because key positions are appointed by the country’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, \nand are answerable to him, bypassing the president’s office.62 The United States designated the IRGC \nas a terrorist organization in 2019.63\nThe IRGC is composed of ground, naval, land, and air forces as well as cyber-focused units, \nwhich have conducted cyberattacks against many targets in Israel, the United States, and Saudi \nArabia, among others. The IRGC also is the parent organization of the Basij, a civilian paramilitary \norganization that manages a legion of cyberwar volunteers recruited from universities and \nreligious schools who also act as a proxy hacker force. While the exact number is unknown, Iranian \nleadership claims to have 120,000 basij cyber warriors. The volunteers are sometimes referred to as \n“cyber war commandos.”64\nAPTs associated with the IRGC include Refined Kitten, Charming Kitten, Imperial Kitten, APT42, \nand Pioneer Kitten, each of which are detailed below.\nRefined Kitten\nRefined Kitten has been active since at least 2013 and is likely tied to the IRGC, according to \nCrowdStrike.65 The group is known for gathering intelligence on companies in the United States, \nSaudi Arabia, and South Korea, with a particular interest in the military and commercial aviation \nsectors and the energy sector, especially companies with ties to petrochemical production.66 These \ntargets are in line with Iranian strategic interests, which include gaining insights into Saudi military \naviation capabilities, supporting Iranian decisionmaking regarding Saudi Arabia, and expanding \nIran’s petrochemical production to grow its competitiveness within the region. Although the group’s \nactivities mainly focus on intelligence gathering, there have been suspected links between Refined \nKitten and destructive attacks such as the Shamoon wiper-malware attacks in 2018.67\nRefined Kitten is known for using relatively sophisticated tactics, including custom-built malware \nand advanced social engineering strategies. This adversary often uses targeted spear-phishing \ncampaigns to gain initial access.

These attacks utilized public scanning tools, one-day exploits, \nSQL injection, and stolen VPN credentials for initial access before moving laterally and \nexfiltrating data. Similarly, between 2022 and 2023, Imperial Kitten conducted strategic web \ncompromise operations, targeting organizations in the same sectors.84\n  \t\n▪\nIn February 2024, Mandiant reported that Imperial Kitten was targeting the aerospace, \naviation, and defense industries of countries in the Middle East, including Israel and \nthe United Arab Emirates, as well as potentially Turkey, India, and Albania. The threat \ngroup used a fake recruiting website hosting a malicious payload to do so. According to \nMandiant, the link between these attacks and the IRGC is “noteworthy given the focus on \ndefense-related entities and the recent tensions with Iran in light of the Israel-Hamas war.”85\nAPT42\nAPT42 has been active since at least 2015 and is responsible for at least 30 confirmed operations. \nMandiant previously tracked APT42 as UNC788 and assesses with moderate confidence that the \ngroup operates on behalf of the IRGC Intelligence Organization. Other cybersecurity researchers \ncombine Charming Kitten’s (APT35) activity with that of APT42, but Mandiant assesses with \nmoderate confidence that Charming Kitten and APT42 are separate groups that both “operate \non behalf of the IRGC but originate from different missions and contracts or contractors based \non substantial differences in their respective targeting patterns and tactics, techniques and \nprocedures.” Similarly, though Microsoft reports a connection between Nemesis Kitten (UNC2448) \nand APT42, Mandiant “has not observed any technical overlaps between APT42 and UNC2448.”86\nAPT42 has targeted the personal and corporate email accounts of current and former Iranian \ngovernment officials, policymakers, political figures, members of the Iranian diaspora, opposition \ngroups, journalists, and academics. It also targets organizations in the following sectors: civil \nsociety, education, government, healthcare, legal, manufacturing, media, entertainment, and \npharmaceutical. However, unlike other groups associated with the IRGC, APT42 does not target the \ndefense industrial base or focus on the collection of personally identifiable information. Instead, \nit seeks out “enemies or opponents of the regime, specifically gaining access to their personal and \nmobile devices.” The group relies primarily on highly targeted social engineering efforts to build \ntrust with their victims.

The group spent considerable time building rapport with their victims, typically \nindividuals perceived as being a threat to the regime, such as NGO leaders and human rights \nactivists. APT42 eventually sent a link to a legitimate conference invitation or other document, \nwhich prompted victims to enter credentials. Upon harvesting credentials, the group gained \naccess to cloud environments and covertly exfiltrated data of strategic value to Iran.88\n  \t\n▪\nIn another campaign beginning in 2021, APT42 impersonated news sources such as the \nWashington Post, The Economist, and the Jerusalem Post to target journalists and researchers \nwith spear-phishing campaigns.89\nMINISTRY OF INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY (MOIS)\nThe MOIS (VEVAK in Farsi) is one of the two most powerful intelligence branches in Iran, alongside \nthe IRGC Intelligence Organization. The MOIS is the primary civilian intelligence organization, and \nall other intelligence services are required to share information with the MOIS. Notably, the MOIS \nreports to the president rather than the supreme leader and “is assessed to be more technical and \nless ideology-driven than IRGC leaders.”90\nThe MOIS’s main priority is to collect domestic intelligence. To do so it “spies on Iranians \nabroad, collects intelligence on other governments, counters foreign intelligence plots, and \nworks with allied intelligence agencies.”91 The organization is known to be responsible for signals \nintelligence and collecting information from electronic communications.\nAPTs associated with the MOIS include Static Kitten, Helix Kitten, Remix Kitten, Agrius, and Chrono \nKitten. The section below details these APTs.\nStatic Kitten \nStatic Kitten has been active since at least 2017. In January 2022, U.S. Cyber Command reported \nthat this APT is a “subordinate element” within the MOIS.92 This adversary is known for targeting \norganizations located in the Middle East and Eurasia, including telecommunications, local \ngovernment, defense, oil, and natural gas companies. Static Kitten is most known for cyber \nespionage campaigns and intellectual property (IP) theft but is believed to occasionally deploy \nransomware, perhaps to cover its tracks.93 According to Microsoft, Static Kitten has collaborated \nwith another threat actor, tracked as DEV-1084 (also known as Storm-1084 and as the DarkBit \npersona); Static Kitten gains initial access before DEV-1084 carries out destructive actions.94 Static \nTable 6: Aliases of Static Kitten\nCrowdStrike\nMandiant\nMicrosoft (old)\nMicrosoft \n(new)\nSecureworks\nOther\nStatic Kitten\nUNC3313\nTEMP.Zargos\nMERCURY\nMango \nSandstorm\nCobalt Ulster\nMuddyWater",

One of the NPDO’s main roles is to use “all national cyber and non-cyber resources \nto deter, prevent, deny, identify, and effectively counter any cyberattack against . . . Iran’s \nnational infrastructure by either hostile foreign states or groups supported by them.” In \naddition to defense, the NPDO also helps coordinate citizen surveillance and supposedly \nworks with the IRGC to conduct offensive cyberattacks.120\nNONGOVERNMENTAL\nIn conducting computer network operations, Tehran often relies on a diverse ecosystem of cyber \nactors that act on behalf of the Iranian government. A proxy-based approach is a feature of Iranian \ncyber operations and reflects Tehran’s approach in conflict zones like Syria and Yemen, where Iran \nemploys both direct and indirect means to exert influence on decisionmaking. Assessments of the \nIranian state’s control over its cyber proxies point to cases where the groups operate without strict \nrestraints. The means and logistics of a cyber response are often as much determined by the proxies \nas they are by the state.121 The use of proxies provides Iran with a level of deniability and the ability \nto maintain that it is a victim in the global cyberwar.122\nProxies and Front Organizations\nIranian companies are known to have perpetrated attacks, in affiliation with the IRGC and MOIS, \nagainst a range of targets, including universities, election apparatuses, and critical infrastructure. \nThe section below describes several proxy organizations that have been responsible for \nhigh-profile hacks.\nmabna institute\nSince its founding in 2013, the Mabna Institute has helped Iranian universities and other research \ninstitutions steal foreign scientific resources. The Mabna Institute employs and hires individuals that \nuse cyber operations to steal intellectual property, academic research, emails, and other sensitive \ninformation on behalf of both the Iranian government and private companies. In March 2018, the \nU.S. Department of Justice indicted nine individuals working at the Mabna Institute for conducting \ncyber operations on behalf of the IRGC. They are believed to have hacked 144 universities and 36 \nprivate companies in the United States, 176 foreign universities in 21 different countries, and 11 \nforeign private companies.123",

For example, some of their claims about \ncompromising Israeli infrastructure have been proven false.135\nIn a notable attack in November 2023, CyberAv3ngers targeted a municipal water authority in \nPennsylvania. The hackers shut down a device that monitors and regulates water pressure at a \npumping station, claiming the attack was meant to target the Israeli company, Unitronics, the maker \nof the industrial control system. Luckily, the staff switched to manual pumping quickly, and there \nwas no impact on the water supply or on the health of the residents who rely on the company’s \nwater and sewer services. CyberAv3ngers has also reportedly targeted a brewery in Pittsburgh, an \naquarium, Israel’s railway infrastructure, and several Israeli water facilities.136\nhaghjoyan\nHaghjoyan is another Iranian hacktivist group that emerged during the Israel-Gaza conflict. The \ngroup self-identifies as “Iran’s cyber army” on their popular Telegram channel, which had over \n40,000 subscribers at one point (see the images on page 28). Haghjoyan’s early attacks primarily \ntargeted Israel, but the group’s focus has expanded to include the United States. The group is \nknown for focusing on data leaks, defacement attacks, and propaganda. In one notable attack, \nHaghjoyan claimed to have targeted several Israeli water pumps, electricity distribution units, and \nvirtual network computing systems at gas stations, highlighting the dangerous reality that this group \ncould disrupt critical infrastructure.137\ncyber toufan al-aqsa\nCyber Toufan Al-Aqsa (“Toufan” means flood in Arabic and is very likely a reference to Hamas’s \nOctober 7th attack on Israel, known as “Toufan Al-Aqsa”) is a relatively new hacktivist group that \nonly recently emerged, in November 2023, but has already managed to attack more than 100 \nIsraeli organizations. According to SOCRadar, the group’s operations “bear the hallmarks of a \nsophisticated entity, potentially state-sponsored.”138 Cyber Toufan has been able to rapidly rise in \nnotoriety and carry out complex cyberattacks that “suggest a level of support and resources that \nare not typically available to independent hacker collectives.”139 The group has leaked sensitive \ndata from private companies and Israeli government targets, including the Ministry of Health, the \nMinistry of Welfare and Social Security, and Max Security (an Israeli cybersecurity company); Israeli \nbranches of multinational companies such as Ikea, ACE Hardware, and Toyota; and companies that \ndid business with Israeli companies such as Berkshire eSupply and SpaceX.140 Cyber Toufan’s wiper \nmalware has caused significant damage to many of these organizations, and the group is known for \nspreading follow-on attacks down the supply chain.\nThe vast array of these actors is telling.

An Albanian \ngovernment official highlighted that Iran had aimed to completely paralyze Albania’s government \ninfrastructure, but that Albania was able to prevent the spread of the ransomware and recover \nmost of the data from a backup within a matter of days.153 On August 12, 2022, the government \nreported, “All the online public services for the citizens and businesses and government websites \nin Albania have been fully restored and are normally accessible after almost four weeks of intense \ncounterattacks against a massive and synchronized cyber attack.” The report indicated that 1,214 of \nthe 1,225 services provided on the e-Albania platform were fully accessible, with a few others, such \nas the ability to issue diplomas, not yet restored.154\nAlbania. The ransom note referenced Durrës, saying “Why should our taxes be spent on the benefit \nof DURRES terrorists?”151",

          "text": "Only a few months later, Tehran targeted Tirana once more. The September 2022 attacks used similar \ntactics, techniques, and procedures and were “likely done in retaliation for public attribution of the \ncyber attacks in July.”155 The second attack targeted the Albanian police force’s Total Information \nManagement System (TIMS), which stores information about people entering and leaving the country. \nThe attack forced police departments across the country to take the TIMS offline for 24 hours. \nAlbania benefited from its strong partnerships with the United States and NATO in recovering from \nthese attack; both the U.S. government and private sector partners came to Tirana to help with the \ninvestigation and recovery.156 Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama tweeted on July 24: “the good news is \nthat the aggression was successfully repelled by an Albanian-American super team, that no data was \ndeleted, that public services are back to work!”157 \nIn response to these attack, the Albanian government fully cut diplomatic ties with Tehran, forcing \nIranian embassy staff to leave the country within 24 hours.158 Ties have not been restored. The United \nStates also condemned the attack because it “violated the peacetime norm of not damaging critical \ninfrastructure that the public relied on.”159\nIn December 2023, Iran, again posing as HomeLand Justice, attacked the Albanian parliament, \nONE Albania, and Air Albania. The attackers used the hashtag #DestroyDurresMilitaryCamp.160 In \nFebruary 2024, they attacked the Albanian Institute of Statistics.161\nThese attacks exemplify many tactics commonly associated with Iranian hacking groups, including \ntheir use of fake personae to avoid attribution and retaliatory messaging, but they also represent an \n“aggressive escalatory step,” according to Mandiant’s vice president of intelligence, John Hultquist. \nPrior to this attack, Iran had only conducted disruptive cyberattacks in the Middle East, suggesting \nthat the country’s risk tolerance for using destructive cyber tools against its adversaries, including \nthose outside of the region, may be increasing. Hultquist also emphasized “whatever deterrents \nwe believe exist between us and them may not exist at all.” 162 So, as Tehran continues to increase \nits cyber capabilities, it will likely be willing to target the United States and its allies with similarly \ndestructive and disruptive cyberattacks. \nJulia Dickson and Emily Harding  |  33\nFigure 2: MOIS-Affiliated Groups Involved in the July 2022 Cyberattack\n  \t\n▪\nDEV-0842 deployed the \nransomware and wiper \nmalware.\n  \t\n▪\nDEV-0861 gained initial access \nand exfiltrated data.\n  \t\n▪\nDEV-0166 exfiltrated data.\n  \t\n▪\nDEV-0133 probed victim \ninfrastructure.",

          "text": "A Playbook for Winning the Cyber War  |  34\nCase Study 3\nIranian Cyberattacks During the Israel-Hamas War\nB\nefore Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, and Israel subsequently invaded Gaza, \nIsrael was already a top target of Iranian cyberattacks. Following the war’s commencement, \nIranian actors seemed to use existing accesses to make a statement, even if the connection \nbetween the target and the war was slim at best. Iran soon increased the frequency and \nsophistication of its cyberattacks in order to undercut support for the war and collect intelligence \non key decisionmakers.163 At first, attacks mainly aimed at quickly stirring public discord, but \neventually they became more targeted and focused on disruption. Iran’s tactics in Israel and against \nIsraeli allies demonstrate key components of its evolving cyber strategy, including its opportunistic \noperations, use of advanced social engineering campaigns, increasing use of cyber-enabled \ninfluence operations, and reliance on proxies.\nImmediately following October 7, Iranian threat actors conducted a series of clearly opportunistic \ncyberattacks combined with influence operations designed to mislead and exaggerate Iranian \ncapabilities and access. Iranian hackers quickly boosted their cyber operations in support of Gaza, \nutilizing pre-existing access and re-leaking old data. For instance, on October 8, Malek Team—\nlikely an MOIS-affiliated cyber persona—leaked personal data from an Israeli university on Twitter. \nWithout any clear link to the Israel-Hamas conflict, Microsoft Threat Intelligence concluded that the \nattack was most likely based on preexisting access and was opportunistic in nature; Malek Team saw \na new opportunity within its existing capabilities and took it.164\nIran also re-leaked old data and published ambiguous details and false information about \nsupposedly successful cyberattacks in state media. For instance, Tasnim News Agency, a news",

          "text": "outlet affiliated with the IRGC, stated on Twitter that the CyberAv3ngers attacked Israel’s Dorad \npowerplant “at the same time as the ‘Al-Aqsa Storm,’” but the group already had claimed to have \nconducted a cyberattack against an Israeli electricity company the evening before Hamas’s attack. \nFurther, a Kaspersky report found that the images posted on CyberAv3nger’s Telegram were \nfrom a 2022 attack by Moses Staff, another Iranian group, which has no known affiliation with \nCyberAv3ngers.165 The confusing information and false claims of Iran’s successes are part of Iran’s \nbroader influence operations that seek to intimidate Israel by overstating Iran’s capabilities. These \nattacks—both real and exaggerated—aimed to affect Israeli citizens’ and allies’ beliefs about the \nconflict, and thereby their behavior, but did not actually cause significant disruption or damage.\nAs the war progressed, however, a growing number of groups shifted their focus to Israel, and \nattacks moved from being opportunistic or fabricated to being more carefully planned and \nsomewhat destructive. Microsoft Threat Intelligence found that 9 groups were targeting Israel \nduring the first week of the war, increasing to 14 groups after two weeks of conflict; the number \nof attacks more than doubled in the first month. Further, multiple groups affiliated with the \nIRGC and MOIS focused on the same targets, “suggesting coordination, common objectives set in \nTehran, or both.”166\nDuring this second phase of the war from mid- to late October 2023, Iranian groups conducted \nmore disruptive attacks while continuing to publish misleading and false information and rely on \ninfluence activity to exaggerate the effects of their attacks and abilities. For instance, on October 18, \nthe IRGC’s Shahid Kaveh Group used custom ransomware to target Israeli security cameras. Soldiers \nof Solomon, one of Iran’s cyber personas, then claimed it had hacked security cameras and stolen \ndata from the Nevatim air base. In actuality, the footage was from nowhere near the military base; it \nwas from a town north of Tel Aviv with a street named Nevatim.167\nThroughout this period, Iran-linked threat actors continued to use advanced social engineering \ncampaigns to target individuals of strategic interest to the Iranian government. In one instance, \nCharming Kitten sent emails to a series of targets, pretending to be a notable individual. The \ngroup posed as a journalist from a well-known news outlet reporting on the conflict in Gaza. After \nbuilding rapport, Charming Kitten sent a follow-up email, including a link to a malicious domain. \nThese campaigns targeted research and academic institutions in Belgium, France, Gaza, the United \nKingdom, and the United States, and they were first spotted in November 2023.168\nAs the war continued to progress, so too did the scope of Iran’s activities. By late November, \nIranian groups had begun targeting countries that Iran perceives as supporting Israel, as well as \nIsraeli-made systems in countries around the world. These destructive attacks highlight Tehran’s \nwillingness to attack civilian critical infrastructure, its general disregard for international norms, \nand its willingness to conduct potentially escalatory acts when operating in the cyber domain. \nIn December 2023, the Iranian front HomeLand Justice used wiper malware against Albania’s \nparliament, two local telecommunications companies, and Air Albania (a local airline).169 Microsoft \nThreat Intelligence assesses that two MOIS-affiliated groups collaborated on this destructive \nattack: One provided access to the network and the other executed wiper malware.
