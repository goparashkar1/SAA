          "text": "Russian Offensive Campaign\nAssessment, September 6, 2025\nAngelica Evans, Olivia Gibson, Grace Mappes, Anna Harvey, Karolina Hird\nToplines\nUkrainian officials warned that the Russian military command is regrouping and reinforcing its troops in western Donetsk Oblast, likely ahead of a\nmajor offensive operation. Ukrainian Dnipro Group of Forces Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Oleksiy Belskyi reported that the Russian military\ncommand is concentrating significant forces in Donetsk Oblast and that the most intense fighting is occurring in the Pokrovsk direction.[1] Belskyi\nstated that Russian forces are now accumulating significant numbers of drones and heavy armored vehicles in the area after failing to seize Pokrovsk\nand Myrnohrad during Summer 2025. The Ukrainian 7th Army Corps reported that the Russian military command recently redeployed experienced\nnaval infantry units to the Pokrovsk direction, indicating that Russia is preparing to re-intensify assaults in the area.[2] The Ukrainian 7th Army Corps\nreported that Russian forces began leveraging infiltration tactics with small teams with the aim of getting as close as possible to Ukrainian drone and\nartillery positions, overextending Ukrainian forces, gaining footholds in forward positions, and expanding the contested “gray” zone. The Ukrainian 7th\nArmy Corps noted that Russian forces intensified offensive operations on the flanks of Pokrovsk using armored and motorized vehicles in an effort to\ninterdict ground lines of communication (GLOCs) and envelop Pokrovsk. The Ukrainian 7th Army Corps reported that the Russian military command\nremains committed to seizing Ukraine’s fortress belt, which consists of Slovyansk-Kramatorsk-Druzhkivka-Kostyantynivka and forms the backbone of\nUkrainian forces’ defense in Donetsk Oblast. A senior non-commissioned officer (NCO) of a Ukrainian brigade operating in the Siversk direction\nreported that Russian forces are conducting troop rotations in the area and that Ukrainian forces anticipate that Russian forces will soon conduct\nintensified offensive operations.[3] The NCO noted that the Russian military command is pressuring Russian units to advance during Fall 2025, given\nthat Russian forces did not achieve their given objectives during Summer 2025. The deputy commander of a Ukrainian battalion operating in the\nKramatorsk direction also reported that Russian forces are building up their force presence in preparation for future assault operations in the\nKramatorsk area and that the Russian military command has deployed unspecified naval infantry units to the area.[4]\nA Ukrainian servicemember reported on September 5 that the Russian military command recently redeployed five to six unspecified naval infantry\nbrigades to the Dobropillya direction alongside a tank regiment, an infantry regiment, and two motorized rifle brigades.[5] The Ukrainian\nservicemember reported that the Russian military command also recently redeployed elements of the 70th Motorized Rifle Division (18th Combined\nArms Army [CAA], Southern Military District [SMD]) to Chasiv Yar. A Russian milblogger reportedly affiliated with the Russian Northern Grouping of\nForces claimed on September 6 that elements of the 76th VDV Division, including its 237th VDV Regiment, are redeploying from Sumy Oblast to an\nunspecified location.[6] ISW recently observed reports that the Russian military command redeployed several units from Kursk Oblast, including\nelements of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade (Pacific Fleet) to the Dobropillya area and elements of the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade (Pacific Fleet),\n177th Naval Infantry Regiment (Caspian Flotilla), and 11th Separate VDV Brigade to unspecified areas of Donetsk Oblast.[7] ISW has also observed\nadditional reports that the Russian military command redeployed elements of the 70th Motorized Rifle Division from Kherson Oblast to Bakhmut,\npossibly to reinforce Russian offensive efforts near Kostyantynivka or Siversk.[8] The Russian military command’s reported decision to redeploy more\nforces to the Dobropillya area suggests that Russia may continue to focus on offensive efforts northeast of Pokrovsk.\nRussian forces are also attempting to interdict key Ukrainian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) in western Donetsk Oblast in order to\ncomplicate Ukrainian logistics and enable further Russian advances during future offensive efforts in Donetsk Oblast. The spokesperson of a\nUkrainian brigade operating in the Pokrovsk direction stated on September 6 that Russian forces are attempting to interdict Ukrainian logistics in\norder to complicate Ukraine’s ability to defend and launch counterattacks along the frontline.[9] The spokesperson stated that Russian forces are\nattempting to identify gaps in Ukraine’s defensive lines and exploit compromised Ukrainian positions. A senior non-commissioned officer (NCO) of a\nUkrainian brigade operating in the Siversk direction stated that Russian drone operators have recently been loitering drones along Ukrainian GLOCs in\nthe brigade’s area of responsibility (AoR) and waiting to strike Ukrainian personnel.[10] A Kremlin-affiliated Russian milblogger claimed that Russian\nforces have intensified first person view (FPV) drone strikes against the E-40 Izyum-Slovyansk highway, presumably from positions in the Lyman\ndirection, and are successfully disrupting Ukrainian logistics.[11] The milblogger claimed that Russian forces have struck 10 Ukrainian military\nvehicles traveling along the E-40 highway in the last few days and that Russian drone strikes may force Ukraine to pursue alternative logistics routes\nto supply Ukrainian positions along the fortress belt. Additional Russian milbloggers posted footage of damaged Ukrainian vehicles along the\nhighway and claimed that Russian forces are also using Lancet drones to strike these vehicles.[12] Russian forces have previously leveraged\ninterdiction efforts in order to create vulnerabilities in frontline Ukrainian positions that Russian forces can then exploit in infantry and mechanized\nassaults.[13] Russian forces have historically relied on glide bomb strikes, and now increasingly drone strikes, to raze frontline settlements and towns\nto the ground in order to destroy any possible Ukrainian defensive positions and force Ukrainian forces to retreat, enabling less costly Russian\nadvances.[14]\nRecent geolocated footage indicates that Russian forces have likely advanced into northwestern Kupyansk following the Russian Ministry of\nDefense (MoD)’s efforts to falsely portray limited infiltrations as enduring advances. Geolocated footage published on September 5 shows a\nUkrainian drone strike against a Russian position in a building in northwestern Kupyansk, indicating that Russian forces have likely established\nforward positions within northwestern Kupyansk.[15] This footage differs from recent footage that the Russian MoD released, attempting to lend\nlegitimacy to inflated claims of Russian advances. The Russian MoD published footage on September 3 showing individual Russian soldiers out in the\nopen and holding Russian flags at four points within northern, northwestern, and western Kupyansk, and the MoD claimed that Russian forces had\nseized about half of Kupyansk.[16] The footage did not show indications that Russian forces actually held any areas in Kupyansk. However, it\nindicated that these soldiers likely infiltrated the town to film this footage. The Russian MoD attempted to portray these limited and temporary\ninfiltrations into Kupyansk as consolidated territorial gains, however.[17] Both Russian and Ukrainian sources rejected the MoD’s footage.[18]\nISW previously assessed that the Kremlin appears to be attempting to exploit mapping methodologies used throughout the war to advance an\nongoing informational effort intended to portray Russian victory in Ukraine as inevitable and push Ukraine to concede to Russia.[19] The September 5\nfootage of the Ukrainian drone strike in northwestern Kupyansk is more consistent with the actual establishment of forward positions.[20] Russian\nforces typically send small fireteam sized groups of personnel on assaults in order to gain positions behind the Ukrainian frontline, after which they\ncan accumulate larger groups and establish enduring positions for further assaults.
