## Trump and Netanyahu riding together to Knesset

By Kevin Liptak

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is riding along with US President Donald Trump in the presidential limousine as they head now to the Knesset building in Jerusalem. The two men were seen speaking inside the vehicle before it departed the airport tarmac.

Trump successfully pressured Netanyahu into accepting this week's ceasefire-for-hostages deal, but there could still be tough discussions ahead. While Netanyahu warned last night the 'military campaign is not over,' Trump was definitive when speaking last night on Air Force One.

'The war is over' he told reporters. 'The war is over, you understand that?'

The two men will have about 40 minutes alone to discuss the discrepancy as they make their way to Jerusalem.
